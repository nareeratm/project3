Enough Mark Wahlberg!,235,1gpas31,https://www.reddit.com/r/netflix/comments/1gpas31/enough_mark_wahlberg/,63,2024-11-12 09:49:41,"He plays the same character in every movie! He's not that charasmatic and in my opinion can't carry a movie alone. He's fine in something like The Departed. He must have one hell of an agent - he is the star in half the movies on Netflix. 

Also, Chris Pratt is not a good voice actor. I wanted to watch the new Garfield movie but can't tolerate his voice acting. 

Both Wahlberg and Pratt are better off in ensemble casts - they're not interesting enough on their own.  "

I really hope this is not a recent change made to Netflix because it is impossible to watch if you have to get up and do things mid-show. Only way I can get it to pause is my refreshing the page or closing down the tab. "

If I plug in a monitor Netflix plays just fine without the display going black. This only happens with Netflix, and only on my TV. Why is this? I used the same HDMI cable with this TV and my previous PC and they worked just fine. The cable also works with my monitor and Netflix, so I don't think it's the cable.

  
Solutions I've tried that haven't worked:

1. Uninstalling and reinstalling the latest graphics card driver

2. disable hardware acceleration on chrome

3.Using other browsers or the Netflix desktop app.

Thoughts on S4 OBX ,0,1gp98o1,https://www.reddit.com/r/netflix/comments/1gp98o1/thoughts_on_s4_obx/,1,2024-11-12 08:32:23,"Yes. I know, the ending is not what any of us fans wanted. But, obviously there was a reason for that, but only the directors and actors know that reason. 

I feel like the plot has slowly weakened. Seasons 1-3 were awesome. I mean it was just great. The friendships, the treasure hunting, the actors, everything seemed so genuine. 

Idk what it is about Season 4, but it just seemed off. It felt rushed if that makes sense. I feel like the actors aren’t as interested, but they have to “stay interested” since it’s their job. Obviosuly, there is something that all us fans don’t know, and will likely never know. 

I’m hoping that season 5 is good, maybe they’ll use the blue crown to bring JJ back? 

Anyways, what do you all think about season 4? I know a lot of people disliked the ending, but we have to give the directors a chance, they might be writing something really good for S5! "
Problème après avoir désactivé toutes les connexions sur Netflix : Image bloquée et vidéos qui ne se lancent pas,1,1gp74gg,https://www.reddit.com/r/netflix/comments/1gp74gg/problème_après_avoir_désactivé_toutes_les/,3,2024-11-12 06:52:48,"Bonjour à tous,

J'ai un problème avec mon compte Netflix que je n'arrive pas à résoudre. Voici les détails :

1. **Contexte :**
   * J'ai récemment reçu un message de Netflix m'indiquant que j'avais trop de connexions actives sur mon compte.
   * J'ai donc désactivé toutes les connexions de mon compte pour remettre de l'ordre, et je suis maintenant dans une situation où rien ne fonctionne.
2. **Le problème actuel :**
   * Après avoir désactivé les connexions sur mon compte, je tente de regarder des vidéos sur Netflix (film ou série), mais l'image reste bloquée et rien ne se passe. Aucun film ne se lance, peu importe l'appareil ou le contenu choisi.
   * J'ai essayé plusieurs appareils (téléphone, TV, PC), mais le problème persiste sur tous.
   * J’ai déjà effectué toutes les étapes classiques pour résoudre ce genre de problème : redémarrage des appareils, vérification de la connexion Internet, suppression du cache de l’application, et déconnexion/reconnexion de mon compte Netflix. Rien ne semble fonctionner.
3. **Ce que j'ai essayé :**
   * Redémarrer mes appareils et mon routeur.
   * Vider le cache de l’application Netflix sur tous les appareils.
   * Déconnecter et reconnecter mon compte Netflix.
   * Créer un nouveau profil sur Netflix, mais le problème persiste.
   * Tester plusieurs contenus vidéo, mais le problème est le même partout.
4. **Mon hypothèse :** Je pense que le problème pourrait être lié à la gestion des connexions et à un conflit avec l’authentification ou la synchronisation des appareils après la désactivation des connexions précédentes. Peut-être que Netflix bloque temporairement l'accès ou n'arrive pas à gérer correctement la session à cause de cette manipulation.

Est-ce que quelqu'un a déjà eu ce problème ou a une idée de comment résoudre ça ? Si vous avez une solution, je suis preneur !

Merci d'avance pour vos retours."

It's just a shower thought from the general vibes I'm getting from these stories. 

Avatar and Lord of The Rings are very black and white and fairly easy to digest for children. Arcane and Game of Thrones are much more complex and grey when it comes to good and bad, and definitely much more grown up in their tone too. Plus Arcane and ATLA are both beautifully animated original shows. LOTR and GoT obviously have a very similar fantasy setting and they are both based on books too. When it comes to the setting though, I feel like Arcane is closer to Avatar: LoK than to ATLA. But I will let that one slide."
Investigation Alien is SO GOOD!,0,1gority,https://www.reddit.com/r/netflix/comments/1gority/investigation_alien_is_so_good/,4,2024-11-11 19:55:14,"BEWARE: one small spoiler at the end… Omg I just have to do a fan girl post over here, I felt like I was watching a reality documentary version of the X-Files, combined with a spot of Mythbusters; and a lineup of incredibly credible and qualified humans, coming together to explore big questions about UFOs and Aliens!

I absolutely love shows and movies about space, UFOs and aliens, but I get so sick and tired of all the same regurgitated stuff; old stories about Roswell, old encounters etc - yes these are all very valid, but investigation alien felt so fresh and current; FINALLY! Something modern we can sink our teeth into, that follows on from the famous military veterans testifying in Congress! 

I am absolutely so desperate for another season, I’ve thoroughly enjoyed watching this. Please give us more! It’s exactly what the World needs right now, the uncovering of current truth about “are we alone”, “why are these things still being kept secret when it’s now undeniable” WE WANT THE TRUTH! And George Knapp is fighting for us all! 

!SPOILER! A thing that hit deep - 

So, when they mentioned helicopters appearing around the time of sightings in Phoenix; and they said it was really common for that to happen - it threw me and my partner! We live in the hills,
Mountain ranges; in an extremely local community, low crime where nothing would ever warrant helicopters… During Covid lockdowns - my partner and I struggled with sleeping and became aware of helicopters flying overhead around 2-4am most nights! They would circle, and get quite low; and we always thought it was weird, we even said “ I bet they’re searching or following UFOs”.

Also there are so many time lines now

1. The 2024 one where now the parents have lost both their daughter

2. One that Summer stays alive and has a life with Lucy, which keep in mind now a security guard is now dead along with the other 2 of summer friends.

3. A whole separate time line when Lucy killed future Quinn, aka the time line we seen when Lucy killed Quinn in the parking garage. I’m supposing when she went back to her house and seen summer is alive and they (Summer and the parents) clearly don’t recognize her bc summer lived so therefore no Lucy

4. The timeline where everyone lives (summer and her friends) and Quinn turns bad aka going to the past to kill summer and her friends. So prior to him going back in time there is a universe where every single one of the friends live and Quinn just disappears.

This is all so confusing, mainly the part that messes me up is how Lucy is even able to have a life in the 2003 time line with Summer. If anyone could explain this the whole time lines thing that would be greatly appreciated "

\- Rating system does not work. You would expect the behavior to be ""Thumbs it down, and it less content like this show up"". I have thumbs down over 170 bollywood movies. My entire feed turned into bollywood movies. I've never watched a single one. 

\- Saying ""garbage bollywood"" is not intended as offensive. I would say the same about any genre, there's just a lot more bollywood movies (over dramatized, big haired, strong indians saving the day by singing/fighting) filling my feed.

\- I write software for a living and am intimately aware of the technical challenges faced when trying to implement any form of filter with the amount of traffic Netflix has. However what they currently have is lazy as hell and ""mobile first"" thinking.  It's terrible. 

\- I'm not asking for more content, I'm asking to be able to filter certain types of content that their filters do NOT filter at this time and their algorithm is completely ignoring thumbs down. (Fix that please). If customer has 177 thumbs down on bollywood movies... stop showing them. "

(SPOILERS) Outer Banks new season is a massive disappointment ,79,1gmvuyr,https://www.reddit.com/r/netflix/comments/1gmvuyr/spoilers_outer_banks_new_season_is_a_massive/,96,2024-11-09 06:08:08,"This show has overplayed its hand. It's just no longer good. And I say this as a fan. I loved the first 3 seasons but it's time to call it a day. 

All the characters have become caricatures of themselves. A shell. Like we get it. Pope is worried about his future and is angsty about all the pressure on him. JJ is a screw up who's throwing his life away but its not his fault, his dad was abusive. Jon B and Sara are in love. But oh wait, Topper is a threat to their relationship and somehow still a jerk after 3 separate redemption arcs that didn't stick. That Rafe guy is Craaaaazy. Oh my godd Kiaras parents are so gonna ground her again. Here comes Shoupe, the good hearted cop who's hands are always tied by higher ups and never believes the kids despite them always being right. *swampy adventure treasure hunt with dangerous men trying to kill them enues, but dont worry, this Rag tag group of 150 pound uneducated teenagers will always find a way to get the drop on trained hitmen*

They have discovered 3 separate priceless treasures and have *NO* money.  And nothing but a raggedy dock shop to show for it and it's already in danger. And this is the crux of the treasure hunter genre with sequels. It's why they never made a National Treasure 3. Because for starters. Treasure hunting is extremely dangerous and often unfruitful. So if you have an ungodly amount of money from all the treasure you've found, you're unlikely to keep risking it unless you've just developed some like, sick obsession. But at the end of the day. Audiences don't connect with rich people making themselves richer. Also when youre rich you have a bunch of resources that take the fun out of treasure hunting. So in order to keep the characters hunting for treasure the author needs to keep the treasure hunters poor. So what does the author do? They have somebody steal the treasure. But the problem therein lies that the story ceases to be about chasing clues for a long lost treasure and instead just becomes a fight to the death for money. So they have the treasure reveal an even bigger treasure or the absolute worst thing is when they make the characters EXTEMELY stupid with their money and lose it all (looking at you JJ). But even so, you can only do all this so many times before it becomes absurd and redundant. 

Don't get me wrong it's kinda poetic to see each character have some old unknown family ties to a treasure. But the treasure is no longer tied to the Royal Merchant. And thats the sad part is I thought the first 3 seasons were good. And minus the cliffhangers for season 4 I think the end of season 3 would be the perfect send off point for the story. The royal merchant leads them to the cross of Santo Domingo which leads them to el Dorado. The story that begins with Cameron ward killing John sr ends with both of them dying. It wrapped everything up nearly in a bow. 

The story now lacks vision and direction. The actors all hate eachother now and it bleeds through. And it got so bad that they broke their formula and actually killed off a main character. But as predictable as this story has become I can only assume they are gonna slide Rafe over into JJs role as the wild card of their group. And just to keep things nice and symmetrical I bet they'll even spark a romance between Kiara and Rafe. And since every great story still needs an antagonist, I can only assume Topper will fill that role solo now. And Sara's pregnancy? Slim chance that sticks. They will probably just have her miscarry. But on the slim chance she doesn't, im guessing timeskip into everyone being retired from treasure hunting and JB and Sara are parents but they get pulled back in when their baby gets kidnapped or threatened. IDK. There's not many options. All I do know is this show should have concluded with the 3rd season."

I’m evaluating the $/hour of my time in whether to upgrade to ad-free. Aka, if I watch on average on an hour a day aka (30 hours/month) 

At a price differential of $8.50 (15.50-7.00). 

And here’s the hard part, on an aggregate basis how many ads and commercial time is there per hour of content. This seems quite variable. For the sake of argument let’s say it is 4 minutes per hour. No idea accuracy of that.

So that’s 30x4= 120 minutes = 2 hours so that would be $4.25/hour. Based on that it feels like it might be worth it; obviously very dependent on how much you watch, and ad density, and personal finances. 

Thoughts? Any better assumptions on minutes of ads per hour?"

For one, I've never once watched anything cocomelon on this account, and secondly, it's not even a kids account. 90% of what I watch on my account is adult-content. So stop trying to shove your mediocre children's game down my throat.

Yes I know it's not a big deal to scroll down to stop hearing/seeing it. However, the fact that it's pinned at the top of my account for weeks it's ridiculous. Every time I open Netflix and hear that stupid jingle play, it makes my skin crawl more and more each time."

Like, instead of working on pushing out the final stranger things season, maybe try pushing out follow-ups to shows that abruptly ended.

"I've paid the membership for the wrong country for 6 years! FU Netflix, I'm canceling!",0,1gl1jkf,https://www.reddit.com/r/netflix/comments/1gl1jkf/ive_paid_the_membership_for_the_wrong_country_for/,16,2024-11-06 22:48:04,"Here's an interesting story...

I created my Netflix account back in 2018 in Romania, where I've always lived. I received a free month as it was back then without having to submit any payment information. At the end of that first free month, I went on a one-week vacation in Barcelona. During this vacation, I received a notification from Netflix that my complimentary month was ending so I had to add my payment details to continue my membership, which I did. At that time, I the Standard Plan cost the same in Spain as in Romania. I used my PayPal account to pay for the membership, by the way, so I didn't notice anything weird about it.

Fast forward six years, and today I got an email from Netflix telling me that they're increasing the price to 13.99 euros. As I don't usually pay much attention to my automatic subscriptions (I know, my bad!) the price sounded pretty high so I went to the Netflix Romania website where to my surprise, the Standard plan cost only 9.99 euros. So I was like, WTF!? Taking a look at my payment history I see that at least for the last few years, I've been paying 12.99 euros for the Standard Plan. While talking to support, they asked me if I live in Spain because all along I've been paying the cost for the Spanish Standard Plan. I told the support, that I live in Romania and haven't visited Spain since 2018. Of course, they told me there was nothing they couldn't do about it and that I should cancel my current plan and restart it again after it expires to switch to the Romanian price.

Of course, I am partially to blame for this situation, but since Netflix can easily find multiple people abusing a single account, can't they figure out you have lived for the past 6 years in a country and paid the membership for another country? At least a notification or something, FFS.

So yeah, I'm canceling and never getting back! ""Thanks"", Netflix"

Most of the shows which are shown as ‘New content’ are shows that were made by BBC, ITV or Sky and have already been available on their platforms before.

So is the lack of new content down to cutbacks at Netflix, a delay in production following on from the actors strike or something else?"

The writing was sharp, nuance and interesting. Kate and Hal have the fish out of the water situation that sometimes is ridiculous, but grounded with discussion about foreign policy and politics.

I was so excited for second season to the point that I rewatched the first season last week. And it still hold up to what I remember. The was a nice blend between homeland and the west wing. Tension and idealism. The writing was so masterfully crafted that I replayed some of the dialogs.

I'm very surprise and somewhat disappointed about season 2. There are still glimpses of the good show from season 1 of course but going through it feel like a slog, compared to season 1 where I felt like I couldn't get enough. 

From storypoint perspective, it moves very slowly and unclear where things are going, except for a few notable scenes such as the church and hosptial discussion scene. Kate and Eidra convo is always a stand out from season 1 but it feels like that overdo it just because it worked well last season. 

Kate as a character feels stuck. At least a few months have passed in the show and she still doesn't remember her staff names and only talkes to a few people again and again. For someone who supposedly a very successful diplomat in a wat zone, she sure has the biggest chip and her shoulder and cant even do well with managing her office and staff. Sure she doesn't like the photoshoot and wearing fancy dresses but grow up. That's the job, she cant just treat her staff badly because of her stress.

To be clear, this is not a criticism on Kerry Russel who have been brilliant and I've admired from The Americans time.

Stuart is just insufferable here. I don't need to explain. He used to be so cool last season.

The Denisson and Kate relationship are just ridiculous now. It was a little bit eye brow raising last season on how much the supposedly party olanning only role for American ambassador has so much push over a British foreign minister. This season is just absurb. He comes to her any time she calls and he just told her the supposed Throwbridge push just as an aside, even though it's huge to tell the US that the UK is going to replace their own PM. 

To be fair I'm only at episode 3 and the only reason I hang on is I know Allison Janney is coming soon. But it's already have the show and we barely have anything happening.

I wonder why the writing took such a nosedive. It's not just about the plot, but the dialogs between characters are so awkward and unnatural. I wonder if it's because of the writers strike that happened and of it affects across the industry. Thinking about House of the Dragon who also had a similar writing nose dive in the second season after an acclaimed first.

Hanging on to this and hope the next few episodes would change my mind. "

It first appeared for me several months ago and I hated it. It reverted back to the old original for a while thankfully, but is now again using the redesign. 

You see barely a 4th of the information you used to be able to see at once, making going through many titles take longer and become harder to remember as you continue to scroll, as they go out of sight so quickly. Overall the giant tiles are wayyy too big. The tiles are so big that they should be called panels not tiles tbh.

Going through a ton of options took long enough the old way to find something appealing to my tastes, and now takes 4 times as long. You have to scroll through so many more times as only a few giant panels are visible at one time.

Is there anyway to revert or opt out? This is annoying enough for me to avoid Netflix as a go to to find something to watch in favor of other apps/services. "

They all show ""HD capable"" and, yet, play at 540p resolution. Very few will play at 720p, which is considered ""HD"" (in 2015), and, even more so exceptionally rare, some will actually make it to 1080p (aside from Netflix titles, which all stream 1080p and up).

Has Netflix lost the licensing rights to stream these movies at ""technically"" HD (720p) and actual HD (1080p)? And, if so, why are they still displaying that they are HD capable if their quality is below even the most liberal of standards for ""HD"" (540p)?

This appears to be a recent issue as of the last month. Even movies Im positive I watched 2 months ago at 1920x1080p are streaming at 540p now (Life 2017, Im 100% sure I watched at 1080p).

We have a family account and the base of the household is my parents’ TV at our home. Me and my sister travel a lot and we sometimes stream over our phones while traveling, but it has never been an issue since we’re home and connected to the home WiFi regularly enough.

Now my mum left 3 days ago for her medical stay at a clinic and I installed her Netflix on her iPad the day before she left and logged in and all was fine. My sister also isn’t home, but she hasn’t been watching Netflix the whole week.

Now starting from two days ago I suddenly got the message on my phone that I’m not part of the household, while literally being connected to the household WiFi. When I went to my parents’ TV (which is the only TV logged into Netflix btw) it also said that the TV is not part of the household. And I had to update the TV as our household TV.

After that it worked on my phone and TV for a few hours until it happened again. And now it seems to be happening over and over again every few hours.

I looked at the logged in devices and there is no other TV logged in. And it also says the last active device was literally the TV of my parents. My mum hasn’t used her iPad to watch anything so far and my sister wasn’t using it the whole week.

What can I do to prevent this from happening?"

Warning: Spoilers

I watched ""There's Someone Inside Your House"" and the next day, ""Time Cut"" was recommended to me.

These movies are almost identical. They both follow a group of teenagers who are being terrorized by a serial killer. There are several details about these two movies that feel intentional.

1. Both movies feature a masked killer

2. The killer resembles in some way one of the victims or potential victims

3. Someone is killed at a party

4. One of the characters is accepted into a fellowship/internship at NASA

5. The town the movie takes place in is small

I can't figure put why Netflix would make two nearly identical movies. Neither movie was good or particularly well written. "

It seems like she’s either incredibly naive or the whole story is a fabrication. 

The narrative that Kirat was just naïve and under “tremendous pressure” doesn’t add up. 

It feels like Netflix, or maybe even Kirat herself, might have staged this whole story. Otherwise, there would have been some real evidence of Simran. (Remember baby reindeer Netflix case)

Literally the day before I watched my downloads without issue. I deleted all downloads and downloaded them again, tried different shows, no fix. Maybe I need to reinstall the app?

I will try all I can to provide new details when prompted or remembered, here isn what I originally posted on r/tipofmytongue  

""I have never been able to find this show, and no one seems to remember it either. **This might be lost media** at this point, and I *know* it was real.

It was a *live action* children's show, on Netflix. It was about **3 kids** who worked together as a secret team. They had a lair and everything, **(2 guys, 1 girl,)** with an advanced sci-fi esque car, *I do not recall it talking* but it had different abilities and forms depending on the monster of the week. The main setting was their own school, a cliche middle school setting.

These monsters of the week were animated in a children's crayon art style. They would scribble and move like a kindergartners drawing. *I do not remember if they were drawings that came to life, or if this was just the show's art style.* There would be a scene every episode where they would get stumped by the monster, return to their lair and think of a new plan. The lair was either a cave or one of the characters basements.

I have looked for this show everywhere, I have asked around this Subreddit & the Discord at least once since 2021. I would love to know if this show is genuinely lost or if anyone truly knows what it is. Please, help me find this Netflix show."""

The more worrying part is that yesterday was indeed the date my payment was due to be debited from my account and was debited successfully according to my bank records.  The real question here is did the scammers manage to get hold of my payment date as well as my email address or is this just the fluke of the century?  And, if they did get hold of the payment date, surely the only place they could have obtained this information from is the Netflix system itself.  I know many of you have received scam emails regarding Netflix in the past, but we all get emails from scammers who are just guessing and hoping that we even do have a Netflix subscription.  My faith in the security is now somewhat depleted I have to say.  Have any of you had a similar experience where you can see some concrete evidence that the scammers may in fact hold some information regarding your account other than your email address?"

Dexter - I will admit I only watched it recently due to it trending on tik tok but it’s one of the best shows of all time and my personal favourite.
2. Black sails - not as well known but it had me on the edge of my seat the entire time and it’s one of the only shows I’ve been able to watch all the way through again. 
3. The boys - not quite on the level of these others in terms of plot and overall quality but extremely entertaining and a 10/10 performance from Anthony Starr.
4. Peaky blinders - yes another basic one, but this show has honestly become underrated. It gets too much hate for being “too popular” that people have forgotten how good it actually is!
5. Vikings - would be higher but the death of Ragnar made me lost interest.
6. Invincible - only animated series on this list, once again probably not on the same level as these other shows but in terms of personal enjoyment it’s one of my favourites.
7. Sopranos - I’m gonna say something crazy but I think this show is slightly overrated, the acting is great and it’s entertaining but has a lot of empty episodes that I found myself having to force myself to sit though. That being said it’s still all time and I appreciate that subjectively it’s one of the best of all time.
8. Barry - the first season is some of the best TV I’ve ever watched and the first half of the last season aswell, it’s a fun watch with some great performances.
9. Family guy - very different from the others but I’ve watched the whole thing a few times so it has to be here
10. Ozark - the first and second season are unbelievably good, it sort of drops off from there in my opinion. Still great though. 

Honourable mentions - modern family, suits, the Simpson (early episodes), the walking dead (earlier seasons), game of thrones (I only had the chance to watch the first season before it was removed from the streaming service I was using, but will revisit later and revise) and prison break.

i do understand alex's reasoning when she couldn't reach tim's expectation. he could have communicated but to be fair, i think he could have understood too. she still cares about him. i wonder if he found another girl who could reach his high expectations. "
Netflix keeps kicking whole family off account,47,1gd5cdm,https://www.reddit.com/r/netflix/comments/1gd5cdm/netflix_keeps_kicking_whole_family_off_account/,22,2024-10-27 14:08:59,We all live in the same house and it still kicks us all off except my dad.

He always uses his phone to watch streaming services and this isn't the first time this has happened. In July he had this problem on his phone but after he came back home we signed him back in and it fixed the problem. I also have my own Google TV that I use on the go and it still works outside of the house.

  
Does this happen to my father because he is away from the household for too long? Like after a certain amount of time of not being under our wifi does his phone automatically get removed as a device and he has to come back? I'm not 100% sure how this works or how to mange what devices can be authorized or not. 

  
Also he believes it's because the email address of the Netflix account is not the same as the email address on his iPhone apple account. I don't think this is correct and it has nothing to do with the password sharing thing Netflix is cracking down on but I figured I would say this. I just need someone else to confirm this is not how this works and it is not the cause of him not being to use Netflix on his phone outside the house."

Also he said he played 2 levels so how did both his son AND wife get hurt in the next level?  Is that why they’re mad, he just kept torturing them after the game stopped?  I’m so confused!  

Ok, also, what was up with the drug dealer?  He was like a DARE dealer.  He was gonna rat them out to the landlord cause their place got messed up?  Huh?

They never revealed why Simran did what she did?

Was it a case of family incest? Was Simran in love with Kirat? 

How do you make and run 60 profiles on Facebook and run them all by yourself without having any kind of outside help?

What did your cousin or the real Bobby ever do to Simran? 

How do you carry on an affair with someone you haven't met or just know online by only chatting with them? How do you not have at length conversations? Did Kirat and Simran both not have jobs?

If they were from the same group and community how did Kirat and her family not try to get in touch with someone else from Bobby's family? 

Why does it seem like even Kirat had some kind of a mental illness or low self esteem to carry on this kind of an affair online for 9 long years? 

Is it really easy in this day and age to lie about being in witness protection or being in a different country? 

I did not get the part where Kirat chose clothes for Bobby's son and Simran sent her the pics? How is it that Bobby's family not file a case of child abuse against her?

1. People don't watch new shows because Netflix is going to cancel it.
2. Netflix cancels it because people aren't watching it.
3. Season ends with a cliffhanger, so people are even more hesitant to watch it post-cancellation.
4. All hopes of renewal are lost as viewership never picks up.

1 and 2 is solely on Netflix management and IDK if anything can be done about it without them re-establishing trust with the audience.

3 seems to be in the hands of showmakers. Maybe drop a satisfying finale every season with some smaller but intriguing threads that can be explored in the next season.

The Frog - what could have been,3,1gbzsgt,https://www.reddit.com/r/netflix/comments/1gbzsgt/the_frog_what_could_have_been/,2,2024-10-26 00:29:12,"I just finished The Frog, and it seems like some people had my reaction where the beginning started off pretty intriguing, but it kind of fell apart and just became increasingly ridiculous for me. I felt like I was setup for this complex and philosophical show, but it ended up feeling like a generic thriller with a very basic Good People vs Bad People morality, with no real character depth. I liked the stylistic choices, including the nonlinear and intentionally confusing editing, but it just felt they were trying to dress up a very generic thriller that didn't really dive into its initial potential.

For me, at least, what I was anticipating to happen I would have found more interesting. I thought both stories were happening at the same time, and that there was going to be a different reveal - the main antagonist was murdering victims, but then passed the bodies over to her accomplice, the serial killer who gets arrested in the motel. No one suspects the antagonist because the serial killer takes the blame for her kills.

I thought that over time, the two main characters (hotel owner and vacation rental owner) would discover this connection, and start to work together to build the evidence against the antagonist by finding subtle clues she leaves behind during her stays. She stays this initimidating looming presence, instead of the ridiculous character she ends up being, while they try to find ways to trick her into leaving more evidence.

Then, over time, they discover this bigger connection of how she and multiple people are working with her to dispose of her bodies for her. She uses multiple people that go to different hotels that get increasingly difficult to track down.

Overall, I just felt like the show was at its best when it was a slow burn, full of tension, and feel like it could have really capitalized on that. The acting and cinematography were really strong and could have been even stronger with different writing, IMO.

Curious what other people think about the unrealized potential in the show?"

Not sure if this is a me thing or more widespread but couldn’t find anyone else talking about it online. I find that any time I try to watch anything in the Netflix app on my iPhone (12 Pro Max, latest iOS and app versions but has been an issue since I first tried it maybe a year ago) the audio will gradually fall out of sync and seems to get worse with time. 

It’s as if there’s no compensation for the 1.25 or 1.5x multipliers not fitting neatly into the (60Hz) refresh rate or something? I find this will immediately synchronise again if I skip forward or back and then will gradually progressively fall out of sync again.

Has anyone else experienced this? Is there a fix? Thanks in advance!"

It boggles the mind that Netflix will give a medium talent like Rian Johnson $470 million to make tripe but won't give one of the greatest directors of all time the money he needs to tell one of the more compelling true crime stories of the 20th century. 

It would have paid for itself dozens of times over to have 5 seasons of Mindhunter exclusive to Netflix.  Every new generation that discovers Fincher would seek it out.

I think if Gacy's executioner was LGBTXYZ, that would have been both ironic and laughable. John Wayne Gacy roasted his victims even if they were dumbheads themselves. If you had friends who were going missing then wouldn't you smell a rat especially if you had a lot in common? Obviously Gacy wasn't any rocket scientist too because he wasn't Jack the Ripper who the cops couldn't catch.

On a different note, John Gacy arguably was both a victim and a villain. His dad used to whack him when he misbehaved and his mum who would catch him stealing her underwear would force him to wear her clothing outside in order that his peers could poke fun at him. This is probably what caused his psychosis besides drugs."

How can some women be so gullible/oblivious that they keep on claiming to be in a relationship with someone they have never met? Why does it take them so long to realise that it’s all a scam?
And on top of it they say that “catfishing”should be illegal and victim shouldn’t be shamed. Like seriously?! How about first behaving like a 35 year old smart and mature woman?
Maybe I’m being too harsh but I really don’t understand how these women (or men) think.

But for a series with multiple seasons, is there someway on Netflix to tell what year each season was released? For example on HBO Max, each season lists the year it was released so you wouldn't have to google it. 

*edit* 
I know you can google it. I was wondering if I was missing something on Netflix that told you that information already."

But the dialogue was so fast and furious and sometimes the subtitles could barely keep up, and sometimes things weren’t clear and at the end there’s a lot of untranslated stuff. Here’s what I need to know:

Is the girl supposed to be the wife of Blondie? She says her mother in law which is Blondie’s mother at one point. That’s what the subtitles say anyway. But they don’t act like they’re married. It’s more like she was someone with a crush on him that wasn’t returned. 

Are the grandparents really dead? At the very end the aunt asks where they are and then the movie ends, as if they’ve been dead all along. But then the scene with the grandfather in the hospital would make no sense. But then at the end all the credits are part of the hotel, and there is something with each of the grandparents pictures. But none of the credits are translated so can’t tell if it’s just some random credits or was like a tribute to the grandparents or something confirming that they were dead. 

Were the two geckos supposed to mean anything? Through most of the movie I thought they were his dead parents, then at the end, if the grandparents are dead I thought maybe they’re actually them instead. Or were they nobody and just two random geckos?"

I think the plot is great, when francis started losing it I was going through a whole rollercoaster of emotions mf genuinely had me shaking in my boots wondering if he’s just paranoid or crazy or both. I don’t think I would’ve liked this movie if it was some cheap hack n slash with a boring plot,shit characters and same old zombie film routine I’m used to by now, this is honestly one of my favorite horror movies from this year.

I think its been at least 6 months since I tried to watch in a browser.  It was certainly before I installed Sequoia.  Everything is working fine on my streaming devices.  My OS is up to date. Chrome and Safari are the latest. I made sure there were no extensions running in the browser.  I cleared cache, cookies, etc and even rebooted.  Nada.  It does the same thing- plays for a split second when I click the play button and stops.  I can advance the position using the progress slider and the image changes, but it stops playing. I checked the javascript console for any errors and I see nothing there.  The network panel shows that all the netflix pages loaded properly.

I'm not sure what else to check.  Next stop will be Netflix support tomorrow, but I'm not chatting with them at 3AM.  I've already tried everything in their support documentation.

Has anyone experienced this problem recently?  I'm wondering if I have some kind of accessibility option enabled on my system that is detected and aborts playing.  As far as I know there is no dedicated Netflix app for Mac and while the M1 can run ipad/iphone apps as well, the Netflix iOS app is not marked as compatible and cannot be downloaded on the Mac.

UPDATE: The problem appears related to the use of Bose QC Ultra bluetooth earbuds.  Playback worked this morning without them paired, so I tried with them and got the same result as last night.  It pauses immediately after the play button is clicked."

Which movie ending left you speechless?,101,1g812ia,https://www.reddit.com/r/netflix/comments/1g812ia/which_movie_ending_left_you_speechless/,175,2024-10-20 22:19:14,"Incendies(2010) is one of those movies. When I first watched it after being recommended by a movie channel on instagram, I thought it would be a typical terrorism based film with lots of killing and moments of sympathy. However, after watching it for the first time, I was completely flabbergasted. 

The unraveling of Nawal's story, her incredible resilience, and the gut-punch of a final revelation made it one of the most gripping and intense cinematic experiences I've had in a long time. What really stuck with me was the way Denis Villeneuve captured the intersection of personal tragedy and broader historical conflict, making it feel both intimate and epic at the same time.

It's not an easy watch, but Incendies is one of those films that stays with you long after the credits roll, forcing you to reflect on the complexities of human nature and the devastating consequences of hatred.

Some other movies that surprised me includes, Children of Men(2006), The Hateful Eight(2015), Tumbbad(2018), The Village(2004).

For example: I've just watched Ordinary Angels (1000% a great movie). I zapped along the movie titles, came upon Ordinary Angels and based on the premise and the thumbnail showing an happy woman designed like an Hallmark movie poster, I decided to watch it. 

Expecting a sappy romantic down-on-your-luck movie, it was a wholly different movie, it was drama, a bit indie-like filmed. It was a great movie and I forgot my disappointment that quickly because I was hooked within 15 mins due to Hilary Swank's great acting. 

Another movie (can't remember the name) thumbnail was a Mariner in uniform arriving on the street all happy. Premise suggested that it was a boy returns to his girlfriend and romcom happy blah blah. I discovered that it was a war movie the whole time and the thumbnail was basically the last 10 seconds of it.

 Crime Drama where the cops/detectives aren't hindered by bureaucracy ,0,1g80c7l,https://www.reddit.com/r/netflix/comments/1g80c7l/crime_drama_where_the_copsdetectives_arent/,1,2024-10-20 21:46:30,"Looking for shows which do not have trope of the detective not being allowed to investigate a certain case, or are constantly threatened to be pulled off, or caught in some institutional bureaucracy roadblock as side plots. These are becoming too tiresome dull as a side plot to me and I'm sick of it.

I just want to see the protagonist/s allowed to investigate the crimes with the full backing of the department and just are able to get *right to it*. This doesn't necessarily mean corrupt cops/detectives at all. I just want to see them focus entirely on the nitty gritty of the investigation."

Dirty Pop: Blimp Manufacturer inaccuracy,0,1g7u1ta,https://www.reddit.com/r/netflix/comments/1g7u1ta/dirty_pop_blimp_manufacturer_inaccuracy/,0,2024-10-20 15:22:54,"I just started watching and when he presents his McDonald's blimp he says it's been manufactured by WDL, as West German company. Then they talk briefly about the owner of that company, framing him as some sort of super na*i. 

I found it strange, because that guy looked way too young in the footage to have been that back in WWII. 

German is my first language, so it's easy for me to google him and that company. Turns out he was born in 1925. So he was 8 when na*is came into power, 14 when the war started and 20 when it ended. In 1943 he enlisted with the Luftwaffe to become a fighter pilot, but the war ended before he was deployed. 

After the war he continued his flight training with the British and was one of the first German pilots to be granted a license by the allied forces. He was also a member of the SPD, which is the social democratic party in Germany. 

I'm not saying it's impossible for him to having held auch views at the time, but he was an influenced young man at best. And he wouldn't have gotten training by the British if he was really deep into the politics of the third reich. 

It's just a small thing and I get that they wanted to get the story across that Lou Perlman would have sold his soul to the devil if the money was right. But it comes across as ""Oh my Gosh! He made business with Germans in the 80s and 90s! They must have all been na*is!"", which is rather annoying for us Germans. And we are the first to admit when somebody was one of them back then, but we also value accuracy. "
The need for growth is ruining Netflix,821,1g6qavx,https://www.reddit.com/r/netflix/comments/1g6qavx/the_need_for_growth_is_ruining_netflix/,171,2024-10-19 02:18:34,"Obligatory ‘this is a product of late-stage capitalism’. But seriously. The constant drive to increase profits is having a serious impact on the quality of the service. First the drive to prevent password-sharing, the price increases, the addition of ad subscriptions… it’s ridiculous. Bearing in mind that Netflix’s income is continuous, with each person paying every month, they make well enough to pay all their expenses and profit. But because the shareholders ALSO want a salary, they demand extra growth every year. Fuck thattttttt. Can Netflix not just profit the same amount every year? Guaranteed higher customer satisfaction and they’re all still making money! 

Anyway little rant about how everything is awful and I hate it here over

I love Anna Kendrick and was excited to see her directorial debut. And while it does feel the film was well directed. There's just a lot about the movie that missed the mark for me. 

And it starts with Netflix themselves spoiling the climax of the movie by making it the TRAILER. Which left me with the impression that it was the beginning of the movie which completely derailed my expectations and threw me off when it turned out to be more of a subtle pressure cooker/slow burner. 

Also the premise of the movie is misleading. Its advertised to be the story about Cheryl Bradshaws close call encounter with Rodney Alcala. But this doesn't even really occur pretty much til Act 3 over an hour into the movie. 

In fact. Cheryl almost feels like a side character in a movie about Alcala. Which would be fine it's just not the movie they marketed. Sadly this was just a case of expectations vs reality. And the reality is I don't feel it lived up to my expectations "

Without batting an eye, she says how she took his new gun and threw it in the trash because ""that's just how I am and I like to press buttons"".

I don't condone violence. But if I spent thousands of dollars on a new guitar/bike/hobby item, and my roommate or girlfriend threw it away ""just because"", violent fantasies would be playing out in my mind.

What an absolutely stupid excuse for a human being.

One thing about all these episodes is they keep talking about how ""XXX"" was the WORST EX EVER. But they never talk about their own roles and things that they did to instigate the treatment they got. I'm not victim blaming, but it almost always takes two to tango.

Whatever it is, that first-ex in the Ben Foster episode was just a dumb POS. She didn't deserve the level of violence brought against her, but man was she dumb and lacking in self-awareness. Apparently getting her finger sliced off wasn't enough to deter her from a second meet. Why? Because the man was hot."
Why are Netflix subtitles options so bad?,0,1g7nsgs,https://www.reddit.com/r/netflix/comments/1g7nsgs/why_are_netflix_subtitles_options_so_bad/,4,2024-10-20 08:26:07,"Considering accessibility and visual impairments that people may have, I would have expected Netflix to have more customisation than this.

The large font size is absurdly big and the small font size is absurdly small.

The majority of subtitles over the years that I have seen in shows have used simple white text with a thick-ish black outline that is easy to read when against a variety of backgrounds. The closest option Netflix has to this is the ""Uniform"" shadow that is a barely noticeable thin outline. Netflix's default font for subtitles is white text with a very subtle shadow behind it. For me, it's hard to read these subtitles when the scene behind it is bright.

The only reason I still have a Crunchyroll (anime streaming site) subscription is because I don't like Netflix's subtitles.

The black background font setting, as seen below, is decent for me but I really think Netflix can do a lot better here.

There's no way to filter out or blacklist tags either. Finding something to watch feels like a chore; I have to use third-party sites. It's as if they don't want my subscription. If someone made a Chrome add-on to filter this mess, they'd get rich.
