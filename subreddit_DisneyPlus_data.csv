please steal this idea.

Create a beach cam loop similar to the Dory reef cam.

The second show in the Phineas and Ferb universe.Really unpopular opinion I prefer it to Phineas and Ferb.The pistachion arc is my favourite part of the series.Theres a Phineas and Ferb crossover and Doof is in most of s2.I think it deserves another 2 seasons like Phineas and Ferb.
Not a lot of people heard of it because the first season aired on Disney XD but the second season aired on Disney channel and at one point was getting more numbers then star vs the force of evil.Apparently Disney apologised to Dan povenmire because of how the show was treated.

>Disney+ provides some plans for watching movies and series **without commercial interruption** – **Disney+ Standard** and *Disney+ Premium*. However,

*amazing how companies can say ""1+1 absolutely =2, we promise. However...""*

>those tiers may **include** limited **promotional content**,**ads/promos before or after playback of content**, clips and trailers for Disney content, products and services, **in addition to branded or sponsored content**. Live content or special events, including reruns, may include commercial breaks or commercial messages.

These will appear as one or two *glitches* but don't give them the benefit of the doubt.  
It's never enough for them to have your cake, they'll always try and eat it too.

Skip the ads, and if they're persistant swap to a different streaming service for an hour. They log every interaction and will know that you reject the ads.

    Edit:

>You check your bank statement, all the bills have been paid, including Disney+, a rare luxury now. There's precious little money left to go out with, but your tired so it's better to stay in tonight anyway. It was another long day at work and you've had to take on more overtime recently.

>You do the bits and pieces of life admin that you can manage before calling it a night and deciding to sit down and watch your favourite show. You scroll past the banners advertising new films and shows, you scroll past the *trending shows* and the *trending films* advert rows, then past the *recommended for you* row of ads to get to the *continue watching* row. This is where you always go at this time, funny that despite how clever these streaming platforms are they never work out you do that first.

>You tap > to move over the shows you started but weren't overly invested in - why are they still advertising these at you - there it is, just off the side. The show you've been watching every evening for the past year.

>You select it, and it buffers for less than a second.

>NEW ON DISNEY - MICKEY GETS A VASECTOMY - THE SHOW EVERYONES CALLING ""WILD""...

>Adverts have slowly migrated from a peripheral, opt-in event to something you have to actively opt-out of at best, more often they're forced on us, there's no choice and they're intentionally designed to be as predatory as possible, sticking in the subconscious part of your brain til you start repeating the jingles and catch phrases to yourself; consume, consume, consume, consume, consume, consume, consume, consume, consume, consume, consume, consume, consume, consume, consume.

And it's kind of weird how they just did not seem to care for accuracy and continuity of the cast, like recasting hook and hades and the weird character plot holes (the charming family in the first 3 movies is different from the one on the 4th movie?...)

I just think that after Cameron sadly passed everyone was ready to move on and close that chapter except for Disney and they wanted to carry on until it stopped making money and it just turned out looking cheap. "

"If you're in the mood for a good movie for both Halloween and Christmas, I warmly recommend ""The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad"".",22,1gidqkm,https://www.reddit.com/r/DisneyPlus/comments/1gidqkm/if_youre_in_the_mood_for_a_good_movie_for_both/,0,2024-11-03 10:11:12,"Yesterday I was feeling in a Halloween-ish mood, so I decided to watch the Sleepy Hollow segment of ""Ichabod and Mr. Toad"", which I hadn't seen in well over a decade. I looked at the top ten movies that day in my country (Canada). Unsurprisingly, ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" and ""Hocus Pocus"" were on that list, as was ""Coco"" (Dia de los Muertos is right after Halloween, after all). Unfortunately, ""Ichabod and Mr. Toad"" wasn't on the list.

I did find ""Ichabod and Mr. Toad"" using the ""search"" feature, though. I didn't feel like skipping to the middle of the movie just to get what I wanted, so I decided to watch the Wind in the Willows segment as well. And both segments were pretty great! The songs are very catchy, and the characters are funny. In addition to Sleepy Hollow being set on Halloween, Wind in the Willows is set on Christmas, making ""Ichabod and Mr. Toad"" appropriate for both holidays.

If you're looking for something fun, underrated, and appropriate for two special days of the year, I heartily suggest ""The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad""."

2. Motor Mania (1950) Iconic and one of the most famous Goofy solos, been shown at driver's eds around the country
3. Pluto's Judgement Day (1935) The best Pluto cartoon bar none
4. Mickey's Fire Brigade (1935) Just fantastic, uses Mickey, Donald and Goofy perfectly 
5. Hockey Homicide (1945) The wildest Goofy sports cartoon
6. Touchdown Mickey (1932) Another football cartoon, but with Mickey as the underdog. Very action-packed 
7. Truant Officer Donald (1941) The best Donald vs nephews cartoon
8. Shanghaied (1934) A quintessential Mickey-saves-Minnie-from-Pete cartoon, with Billy Bletcher voicing Pete for the first time
9. Sleepytime Donald (1947) Need a film with where Daisy is the main character
10. Traffic Troubles (1931) A great Mickey cartoon and one from 31 which is an unrepresented year
11. Mickey's Good Deed (1932) Another Christmas cartoon, one which uses Mickey's character well
12. Puppy Love (1933) A cute Mickey-Minnie story with pathos
13. Two Chips and a Miss (1952) Chip and Dale solo, the better one. 
14. In the Bag (1956) Humprey Bear solo with catchy song and guest appearance by Smokey the Bear!

Musical score missing from original but present in a foreign dub?,6,1gbck6m,https://www.reddit.com/r/DisneyPlus/comments/1gbck6m/musical_score_missing_from_original_but_present/,1,2024-10-25 03:29:52,"So this is probably the weirdest thing I’ve ever noticed and I’m starting to think I’m crazy….

Basically I’m Polish both but grew up in the UK and as such I had a fairly even split of Disney VHS growing up between English and Polish. So some Disney movies just grew up knowing in a foreign dub over the original and some of the originals I’ve never even seen because I don’t feel the need.

Well on Disney plus, obviously if the language is set to English, I have to change it to Polish for specific movies so I sometimes hear a few seconds of the original sound. And I noticed something odd when I started rewatching Robin Hood just now.

Basically during the first scene where Robin and Little John discuss the sheriffs men getting better with their aim and Robin discovers the arrow in his hat, there is clearly NO musical score playing, it’s just dialogue. As soon as I switched to Polish, and I NEVER noticed this before, there is a subtle score playing and there are also two “sound effect” for comedy, one when John pretends to strangle himself and one when Robin playfully throws the arrow at him.

Is there some mistake with the Disney plus audio, because how can the original Disney recording of one of their own movies have no music in it, but whoever did the Polish dub in the 90s is allowed to add a whole score to a scene? I paused the movie to write this, so I don’t know if it’s the same in other scenes but I’m just so confused and more than a little intrigued. "

>RIL had explored various strategies for the streaming business. At one stage, it considered integrating Disney+ Hotstar into JioCinema, and there were discussions about running two separate platforms—one for sports and another for entertainment.  

>""However, Reliance's leadership opted to keep Disney+ Hotstar due to its superior tech infrastructure,"" a source aware of the discussions said.  

P.S.: The Viacom18 name is a remnant of Reliance's previous joint venture with Paramount which ended last year when Reliance decided to acquire majority of Disney-Star. Paramount sold its shares back to Reliance but they still license content to Reliance's current streaming service and would most likely continue licensing content to Disney+ Hotstar after the merger.

They did something similar with ""Young Woman at Sea"" which premiered in theaters in May and arrived on Disney+ in July as an original. This way, Disney+ would have more and higher quality content, making it a real competitor for Netflix.

I’m thinking about switching to the d+/hulu/max bundle, ad supported for a dollar more than what my premium d+ is going to increase to. How bad are the ads?

PSA: Legacy Disney Bundle costs more than the current bundles if you have Hulu Premium.,57,1g11p98,https://www.reddit.com/r/DisneyPlus/comments/1g11p98/psa_legacy_disney_bundle_costs_more_than_the/,27,2024-10-11 11:26:42,"TL;DR: Disney+ Legacy Bundle + Hulu Premium costs $28.99/month, and is about to go up to $32.99/month. Disney Bundle Trio Premium gives you the same access for $24.99 (edit: about to be $26.99), or $19.99 for Duo if you don't care about ESPN.

Found out today that I've been paying $28.99 for the legacy bundle for the last year when I thought I was paying $18.99. When I first signed up back in 2019 I'd already been paying for Hulu without ads for years, which was $11.99 at the time. If you were an existing subscriber they just charged you twice: once for Hulu and then again for the Disney+ bundle minus the cost of a normal, ads-included subscription, which came out to $7. Still a better deal than paying for them separately even if I had no interest in ESPN.

Fast forward 5 years, Hulu Premium now cost $17.99 (about to go up by $1), Hulu with ads cost $7.99, and the legacy Disney bundle cost $18.99 (about to go up by $3). This means I was getting billed $17.99 for Hulu and $11 for Disney+. This lead to a very confusing conversation with support because both my Disney account page and my Hulu account page say I should be paying $18.99, I'd long since forgotten how the original billing worked, and the support person had a hard time figuring out how to explain this mess.

Anyway, just wanted to post about this experience in case anyone else has been overpaying for the bundle. Disney really needs to integrate this stuff better so the billing is less opaque."

Then you have episodes happening way out of Order with Episodes like The Route of All Evil officially it's Episode 12 of Season 3 but on Disney Plus It's Episode 3 of Season 5. I just think it's a bit too inconsistent with where the episodes line up, and for someone like me wanting to watch the episodes in order it's just a bit of a hassle.

I know it's doesn't really matter as it's a bit like the Simpson's in that anyone can watch any episode and it'll be a self-contained story besides a few plot lines and plot points here and there, I tried messaging Disney Plus but it didn't work and wouldn't send through.

Does anyone know if they plan to fix this at all or do they just not care."

The biggest mystery for me on Disney+ is what the mystery element of either of these movies is.   
(\*EDIT: this post originally contained a screenshot of Sister Act and Sister Act 2: Back in the Habit, under the Disney+ category ""Fun Mysteries,"" that apparently keeps getting deleted )

That, and why after 5 years of complaints, they still haven't given people a way to clear out their ""continue watching"" section, or hide things they have absolutely no interest in watching

Will the $30 annual price hike (for those in Canada) go towards fixing these things? Or actually building an algorithm that recommends things based on your watchlist/already watched, instead of pretending you have one? Because I feel like if that algorithm actually existed, the current first suggestion of my ""recommended for you"" section would not be a movie I literally watched last night, or a bunch of shows I'VE ALREADY WATCHED."

4. Completely whited out Darth Vader was all chill like a regular dude - I don't even know what to think about that.

5. I'm a droid lover in every iteration of Star Wars. When Servo was obliterated I went nuts. I didn't calm down until he was rebuilt.

 I loved the show. I love Lego Star Wars shows in general though, so I am a little biased.

What did you all think of the show? Landalorian? I literally yelled at the TV and said ""NOOOOO!!!"" when evil Grogu came forward. I'm am not having that."

What are the bestest ones on Disney+? 

Also, no hope of Der Fuehrer's Face getting put on Disney+ even if they put in an unskippable Leonard Maltin explanation about how it was propaganda during a world war, like the DVD release? It won an academy award, is pretty funny, and is a lot less ""mean"" than the Warner Bros propaganda movies. The DVD is only 480p so doesn't look very good on modern TVs."

Gift card & d+/max/hulu questions,4,1fz6u6r,https://www.reddit.com/r/DisneyPlus/comments/1fz6u6r/gift_card_dmaxhulu_questions/,1,2024-10-09 01:26:25,"Got a gift card for Disney+ from disneymovieinsiders. I had an annual subscription but the gift card said that gift cards are only redeemable on monthly subscriptions. Which was fine because my annual plan expired yesterday so I just cancelled that one and let it run out. Went to sign up today and found out that you can’t use a Disney plus gift card to pay for Disney/Max/Hulu. Chatted with support and the rep told me that they were “working on getting it to work with the new plan” but that right now I could only pick from the other plans. So I asked if I could just sign up for the bundle and then redeem the gift card for the next month. The rep then told me that I couldn’t do that and that I could only use a gift card prior to having an existing subscription. 

My question is, does this make sense? Was I given incorrect information? Why wouldn’t I be able to add a gift card to my account if I had a monthly subscription? If you can only use it prior to having a subscription, what happens to the remaining funds on the gift card? Does it not carry over and apply to part of your next month’s subscription? It’s not a huge deal because I got the gift card for free but it’s slightly annoying because you should just be able to add a gift card like Netflix does and just have a balance on your account until it’s depleted. I shouldn’t have to jump through all these hoops to use a gift card.

So for fun I came up with some ideas for shows I'd like to see. Do any of them catch your eye?

**Glory Days (Incredibles)** \- Bob and Helen tell their kids stories of their old superhero days. The show would explore how Mr Incredible and Elestagirl started out as rookies, when he first teamed up with Frozone, his friendships and rivalries with other supers, and the two first met and fell in love. The show would also feature an overarching story with the main supervillain toying with the heroes and trying to tempt some of them to join his gang.

**Tankhood (Finding Nemo)** \- The tank gang now finds themselves trapped in the Marine Life Institute but have been separated from each other in different tanks. Gill must find a way to reunite everyone and break out. Along the way, the group will grow as individuals and some like Gurgle will wonder if they even want to return to the ocean.

**Cooking with Remy (Ratatouille)** \- Follow Remy and Emelle as they teach you how to (not) prepare cullinary dishes in your own home. Each 11 minute episode will have the duo comedically fail each dish, from Emelle eating all the ingredients before they hit the oven, having their Dad hijack the show, to even starting a small fire.

But-- and I apologize to this-- I feel that they dropped the ball by being so self-contained.  Now I don't expect the many cameos such as in D&W, but there are people from Madisynn to Nico Minoru who could have made appearances and fit in nicely.  That being said: where would Nico slot in if she was in Agatha's coven?

My working theory is that she'd be a blood-witch because her mother was one.  What do you all think?"

Constructive Critiques for Disney+ Streams,1,1fty27o,https://www.reddit.com/r/DisneyPlus/comments/1fty27o/constructive_critiques_for_disney_streams/,7,2024-10-02 03:21:48,"So to start, I actually really enjoy this feature, Hits & Heroes has been my favorite channel so far. It's a good start, but here are some areas that I feel it could improve; especially when comparing with other streaming services that have this feature as well, like Paramount and Pluto.

First and foremost, the channel selection, it's very bare bones at the moment, I feel they need like ten more channels at least, but off the top of my head: A Marvel dedicated channel, a Star Wars dedicated channel, a cartoon channel, a Disney Channel for new and one for old. Some channels that are focused on just movies, like a DCOM dedicated one, or a Pixar dedicated one would both be great.

The next thing would be a schedule, right now we have no idea what is coming on next, like we could be watching an episode of Ahsoka and then the next thing to come on will be Black Panther and we have no idea before hand.

Also while I don't really want commercials, I do think a channel bumper or two, in between movies and shows would help make the transition from one show to the next not be so jarring. Even if the bumper is just the channels logo for a couple of seconds.

Also, fix a couple of the small bugs,  like how Hits & Heroes has gotten desynchronized on the UI with what the channel is actually showing, like right now WandaVision is playing, but for a while it was saying Attack of the Clones was still playing. The UI is about 30 minutes behind the actual channel."

With the kids, we added Disney+. Then our oldest wanted ESPN+. For a while, we had a discounted bundle (due the to free Hulu) which has since become the Legacy bundle. I just saw this bundle is increasing $3 to $21.99/month in October. With all the Disney stuff going on with channel removal, our cable provider now offers us free Disney+ w/ ads. So I technically get Hulu and Disney+ for free. The only thing we should have to pay for is ESPN+. I’ve had trouble finding accurate stand alone pricing, but as far as I can tell it looks like ESPN+ is $11/m or $110/yr. So I should be able to save $11/m by having 3 logins, but we will have ads on Disney+ then. Does that make sense? Will 3 logins make it harder on the individual apps, do they work together in any way? I was just wondering before I move in this direction. Thanks."

Normally this would be $7.99/month (they’re raising it in October to $9.99/month. This is my first time using the service. I’m watching Naruto Shippuden and the episodes average about 23 minutes of playtime including intro music and ending credits (~2 minutes every episode). I’ve kept track of how many ads I’ve received in the course of one episode: about 6 and a half minutes. For this episode in particular, that means a show-to-ad ratio of nearly 3:1. This feels even worse due to the time taken by intro/credits. With this in mind, suppose I watch the first season (35 episodes). That would be nearly 230 minutes of ads. Suppose I watch the entire series (500, yes Naruto is notoriously long). 3,250 minutes of ads, multiple days of ads—prescriptions, cars, cleaning products, soft drinks, fashion, ads presumably repeated numerous times, for one show.

I’ve elected to purchase the show on DVD, and to cease using the service altogether. 

TLDR: Disney plus show-to-ad ratio for basic members is nearly 3:1. That’s absurd.

Edit: I’ve removed a sentence I included at the end that was asking if people remembered a time when it was different. It appeared to be steering the discussion towards cable vs streaming. "

I know that the 2006 Eragon movie was a failure because it received alot of negative criticism from the critics and fans due to the unfaithfulness to the source material (but a few critics did praise the CGI and the acting of Jeremy Irons). But my main concern about this live action TV series is whether or not it will be faithful to the books and perform alot better than the 2006 movie. What's everyone's thought about whether or not this live action tv series will perform better than the movie or fail again

""How Disney Built America"" explores the history of Walt Disney and how the iconic Disney brand, fueled by the creation of beloved characters, cherished family films, thrilling theme parks, technological innovations, and more, continues to shape generations as a cultural and worldwide phenomenon. This nostalgia-filled ride paints a vivid picture of the world of Walt Disney and the empire he built, with each episode focusing on a different example of the game-changing brilliance in Disney's history, including inventing the world's most recognizable characters, creating the animated features industry, revolutionizing the concept of merchandising, and using groundbreaking engineering to construct Disneyland, Walt Disney World, and beyond. Rarely seen archival material, original dramatic recreations, and key interviews expand on how the brand is forever woven into the fabric of American life. ￼"

In 2025, we got the release of Daredevil: Born Again which could be biggest and best Marvel Show of 2025 depending on if the viewers love it, and really a saving grace for Marvel TV and Disney +, but on the other hand we got Ironheart which is a show I hope is gonna be good, but I feel like it's gonna get so much hate depending on if there is someway to save the show

Also we got The season Finale of Andor which could also be a another comeback for Star Wars depending on the viewership and ratings in 2025

Pixar and Disney got Dream Productions and Percy Jackson Season 2 which could be something special, so in the end I think 2025 could be an Improvement from last year for Disney +, what do you think??

Did a search and superkitties shorts show up but not the actual show.

Tried this with Bluey, same thing.

I haven’t changed anything with parental controls, and considering the content level wouldn’t expect this to be the issue - guess I’m wondering if anyone noticed anything similar?"

I watched The Rescuers and Oliver and Company today.,16,1fig6xs,https://www.reddit.com/r/DisneyPlus/comments/1fig6xs/i_watched_the_rescuers_and_oliver_and_company/,5,2024-09-17 04:14:34,"The Rescuers was my first time watching it, O&C I watched when I was younger but didn't really like. Here are my thoughts on both:

The Rescuers - This is an absolutely gorgeous movie. Just absolutely gorgeous. The music and visuals are some of the best I have ever heard and seen in a Disney movie and the whole movie feels very wholesome. It gave me a strong wave of nostalgia even though I have never seen this movie in my life. My only problem was that the whole thing with Penny being used to get a diamond felt like it didn't really fit with this movie. Like, she could still be in trouble, but the situation she was in I feel like didn't fit. Still an amazing movie, I really enjoyed it, and I know for a fact I would've enjoyed it when I was younger.

Oliver and Company - Okay, there's NO WAY this is a Disney movie. Jokes aside, I know it is. But my God, this doesn't feel like a Disney movie at all. ESPECIALLY the music. Someone recently played the Why Should I Worry? song from this movie and I literally thought it was coming from the 80s station on the radio. Had a very hard time believing it was a Disney song. The whole movie overall is very very 80s - animation style, songs, whole vibe honestly. And I love the 80s, I really wish I was alive back then, and this movie made me very happy. I actually, quite frankly, liked it more than The Rescuers. Not to mention way stronger characters - my personal favorite was Tito. This movie has a lot going on, but I absolutely loved watching it."

while i think that the newly introduced characters are slightly lackluster and just the typical ""stupid kid"" in a cartoon. except jedi bob he was hilarious. overall it is definitely worth a watch, just some lighthearted star wars content with humor and references that the average star wars fan should understand and enjoy."

Is it a lot or just a few. I have the basic Netflix with ads subscription and most of the ads I see queued up don’t even air and are very infrequent. I can watch an entire movie and maybe get 1.

My Own Disney+ FAST Channels,6,1fbbzxp,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1fbbzxp,5,2024-09-08 00:14:25,"I have a huge obsession with streaming services and even more obssessed with FAST Channels. So far, my favorite streaming services are HBO Max, Disney+, and Peacock. 

Lately I've been getting into taking my watch lists to the next level. I'm sure at one time or another, you've been scouring the library of all these streaming services in pursuit of the next watch and have been overwhelmed by the plethora of choices. Your watch list 100-200 items long knowing full well you'll never truly watch it all. 

Well I took a note from some of these FAST channels and broke down the basic bare bones. A bunch of movies/shows on a grid that are set to run on schedule. I applied that same concept to my watch list and created my own ""FAST Channels"". 

Now unfortunately I don't have the technology to have thrse pograms run automatically so it does take a modicum of effort but I'm pleased with the results. It's sort of modeled after Peacock's channels approach, some things are Live but some channels are VOD only. They're available to watch from the beginning for an hour or two before moving on to the next thing.

So I have 24 - 1 hour blocks where a movie or a show will be available you watch. For example Avengers: Infinity War may be available to watch at 8pm and then Frozen is available to watch at 9pm. So let's say I watch Infinity War at 8pm. It'll probably take until 10-11pm to finish. So the next thing I'll watch may fall under the 10pm or 11pm timeframe. 

It's not perfect but it helps me make more clear decisions. But the cool thing is this can be applied to any video library as long as you have a list, a schedule, and a list randomizer to help shuffle your selections. It's like your own personal tv networks designed for you! So if there's still nothing to watch then I don't know what to tell you. Haha! 

All I did was make a list, shuffled that list up, and pasted it onto a list with hours to coincide. 

Now like I said before, my big 3 are MAX, Disney+, and Peacock. MAX has HBO, so if you have access to those channels then big whoop. Peacock has their own channels so maybe it's not necessary right now.

But Disney+ has a glaring lack of any ""FAST channels"". I know they said they're roll some out soon but in the meantime, I took it upon myself to make a few of my own. 

Now somethings may overlap or repeat but most of this is generated from my own watch lists and personal taste. So maybe there's not enough but I'm content. 

My channels are as follows: 

Disney+ (East) & Disney+ (West): I modeled these two after traditional tv networks. Both channels contain a list of the Top 200 Movies and Top 100 Shows based off of Reelgood's recommendation. It's sort of the ""main"" channels if you will. 

Walt Disney Studios: This channel will have a selection of movies from Walt Disney Studios, both animated and live action. Now most of movies in this selection are more contemporary. I do have the Renaissance stuff too. But that's because I have some classic channels too to satisfy stuff from the ""Vault"". 

Pixar: Every Pixar movie I can find. Pretty simple. I would like to add all the Pixar shorts but I think an hour is too long, nit sure if you can even watch all of them in a hour. But maybe I'll create like a 30 minute block for it or something. 

Marvel: It's like it says. My favorite channel. For now, I just have the movies. But sometime in the near future, I may add the shows. I do love me some animated 1990s Spiderman and X-Men! But for now, all I need is the Infinity Saga... and I guess the Multiverse saga. Haha!  As well as classic Marvel movies like Sam Raimi's Spiderman Trilogy, X-Men, Deadpool, and others. 

Lucasfilm: This is Star Wars and Indiana Jones. My second favorite channel. All the movies on repeat. Again, no shows but maybe I'll add The Mandalorian or the Bad Batch at some point. 

Animation: This one's simple, all WDS and Pixar movies on repeat. 

Action: All the live action movies. Marvel, Star Wars, Pirates, Tron, Avatar, you name it, it's probably on there. 

Classics: Every animated classic from the 1930's to 1999 and everything in between. 

I may add a Disney Channel channel at some point. Although I never got into it much because I was more of a Nick kid. Also I don't really have much knowledge past like 2004. When I think of Disney Channel, I think of Recess or that Disney Channel movie Brink. Although I do like me some Phineas and Ferb. But who diesn't? 

Anyways, this is getting a little long. Thanks for reading my rant and check it out! Let me know what you think! I make a schedule for one week at a time. It's always changing. 

I also have one for HBO Max, Hulu, Peacock, and my own personal Univer Studios and Quentin Tarantino movies. "

I’m curious about how people actually use the 'Watch List/My Stuff' section on streaming platforms like Netflix, Prime, Max, Disney+, and others. 

This feature allows us to save movies, series, and other content we like for later viewing or easy access. But I’m curious to know more about how this function is used in everyday life by different people.

I would like to know:

- How do you usually use the 'Favorites' section? Is it more for organization, quick access, or another purpose?

- Have you ever felt overwhelmed by having too many things saved and not knowing where to start? How do you manage that?

- Does the 'Favorites' section influence your decision on what to watch at a given moment?

- Do you use this area in combination with other features like 'Watch Later' lists or live content?

- How easy or difficult is it to navigate this section on the platform you use? Is there anything you would like to improve?

- How does the platform handle recommendations based on your 'Favorites'? Does it help you discover new content, or is it more of a distraction?

I’d love to hear about your experiences, challenges, and even suggestions to improve this feature. All opinions are welcome and will be super helpful to better understand how this resource is used in practice.

Thanks for sharing!

Before the events of the movie, he was simply just doing his job in guarding the Underworld (a job he was forced to do by his brother; Zeus against his will, which he of course hates)! He was looked down on by all of the other Gods for no particular reason! Sure it’s suggested that he has quite the big mouth, and throws a lot of witty remarks that get under their skin. But you also have to put into account of how he kinda uses this behaviour as a way to mask how miserable and unhappy he truly is deep down. Plus he is laughed at for having the job nobody else wants to do! 

He reached a breaking point where he was fed up with being disrespected, he finally decided to take action and do something about his situation even if he needed to do evil things in order to achieve it! 

I’m not saying that puts him in the right, but you do understand where he’s coming from and isn’t just someone who loves chaos for the sake of it! "

I'm not here to complain about this (or violate the sub's rules) but I have a situation where my Disney+ account (which I pay for) is being used by my parents in LA and (occasionally) by me in NYC. They rarely leave LA, I divide my time nearly equally between the two cities (they are quite elderly) but my permanent address is NYC.

The thing is, they watch Disney+ FAR more than I do at this point and the main reason I keep the subscription is because I don't want to take it away from them or have them add yet another cost when they are fixed income and already spend a fortune on cable, etc. 

When the time comes I would be more than ok with losing the ""privilege"" of watching the service I pay for in NYC if they could end up using it without a hassle but, as I said, my primary address is NYC as is my credit card billing, etc.

Does anyone know a way that I can ensure that it's their location that is recognized as ""legal""? I have an annual subscription with a half a year still on it and I really would prefer not to sign up for another."

I thought to myself, why does it have ads if it’s being promoted alongside content where I pay a subscription to see content without ads? 

I went back to the title screen for the movie in Disney+ and it had, in small print, a note to say that it was available for streaming in D+ because of my Hulu subscription. 

I then had 3 questions - 1.) why is D+ gaining access to my other apps, without permission? 2.) same as my initial question, does Hulu have ads alongside content where I pay a subscription to see content without ads? 

I went back to Hulu, went to the same movie, opened it - no ads.

3.) why does D+ take content from other sources which are available because I pay for them, and insert ads for their own profit on top of content that isn’t theirs?

This feels wrong. Thoughts pertaining to these observations?

---

**Responses to recurring comments**

1 - the accounts are separate - completely. My account is D+. With my credentials, my email, created before I met my wife. The hulu account is hers. Both WITHOUT ads. They have never cross pollinated with the exception of being on the same device. 

2 - Neither of us have bundles. I understand a few of you are making kind suggestions to help us save some money every month, but thats not the primary concern or reason I bring this up. This is about privacy.

3 - ToS I agreed to under D+ several years ago would not constitute acceptance for my wife's service, and vise versa. Apple is a third party to this, when searching the lengthy ToS, no hits of 'Partner' or 'share' or 'disney' addressed this situation. Apple is a third party that tries to position itself as privacy sensitive. It is highly unlikely that Apple would be facilitating a data exchange that isnt kosher

4 - If this is truly (somehow, despite fully separated accounts) a D+ feature where they talk to each other and allow content to be shared, why are we paying for no-ads, and then the same company turns around and puts ads in it?

I fully understand I came to the D+ sub with something that wasnt pro-D+ -- but thats why I'm here, I want to know why. I have not seen a comment that makes sense as to why, which makes it a bit shady to an outside observer who is not all gung-ho on Disney everything. The wider perspective doesnt have a clear answer

I think was overall done really well. while i do agree that some plot points were interesting and slightly weird (like the fight between 2 giant gods in the middle of cairo) i think it was overall a really great show.

I heard a lot of people think this is a really bad movie. 

I think it’s bad to mixed. 

I want to give it a little credit because  I think it’s really honest attempt at something heartfelt and interesting. 

I think it’s biggest sins are that the characters aren’t really given time to become interesting. 

Like chicken little’s supposed to be this aw shucks guy that we root for - why? Yeah he’s pathetic, seems well intentioned 

But literally the most of his personality we see is the little montage of him trying to get to school. 

And his friends are even worse. 

His pig friend is literally just a fat joke vessel. I found him funny when he got mad /serious though. 

The fish is nothing and the duckling is probably the best character until she turns into an idiot after the kiss.

Also 

Once the spaceship comes into play the story kind of just devolves into absolute. Nothingness. 😂

This movie has **no** awareness of pacing, it’s literally - the sky is falling/ no it isn’t - the sky really is falling/ no it isn’t - **Full blown alien invasion** 

Like who am I supposed to care about at this point ? Chicken little? The orange fur baby ? What the hell is happening 

Then he and his father have this forced heartfelt moment in the middle of the madness😂no. No thank you. 

Then Little and Duckling kiss and again are we supposed to feel something here ?? 

Then they’re still running with this Dadd you have to believe your kids! Angle 

This movie is just nothing, because it doesn’t give itself time to become anything.

It’s not offensively bad but it really is a flash and a bang of nothing in the end.

When I log in to Disney+ under the Gmail address, it asked me to select a plan and acted like I hadn't activated the bundle. I assume people have run into this before from some other searches I did?

Since Disney+ Launched back in 2019 i have noticed a trend that most of the Disney+ Original Series get 6-9 Episode Seasons with most of them not getting a Season 2.


It feels like it is a very annoying thing from Disney because they were quite a few really good series made by Disney+ but they only got a 6 Episode Season that ended with a cliffhanger and never got a Season 2.



Why does this happen? Disney is known for spending so much money on movies so i don’t get why they don’t ever give any Disney+ Series more Episodes or a 2nd Season. A lot of people really like these series and get invested in it and the characters but unlike almost any other company that would make a second season to a popular series Disney just never seem to do that sadly.

And they always seem to end these series with a cliffhanger and if Disney were never planning to make a second season i don’t know why they would end the series with a cliffhanger



Tldr: Disney+ Series always have short first seasons that end with cliffhangers and never get a Season 2 even if they are successful."

While they share it with me and my brother... I'm really the one that gets the most use out of it.

They have finally decided to terminate their account in a few months' time, as the ever-increasing price tag has made them feel it's not worth it, given that they don't use the service as much as I do (and I don't think they realize how often I do). So from their perspective, it's not worth it.

But I still want Disney+. Looking at the payment plan options, though, I think I will stick to the version with ads, that I've never had before. So I'm wondering: how bad are the ads? Do you get them, like, every five minutes? Or is it just like... one ad per episode/movie that you stream?

we’re super confused as to how this could have happened because we don’t share the password with many people, the password isn’t something you could have guessed and even with giving the password to someone outside the family, we don’t get how people in different countries could’ve gotten it as well as the email. even though there were 6 logins, disney plus only alerted to the one in our local area which is annoying and the fact that every login occurred at the exact same time is also super weird. 

has anyone experienced this before or does anyone know what’s likely to have occurred? after contacting disney plus they didn’t have much of an explanation, all they could do was ip ban everyone who logged in without authorization and they manually changed our password. "

With talks of DreamWorks classics like how to train your dragon and others getting live action remakes or sequels, it would be interesting if we got to see more of Tod's story. Some would argue the ending is perfect and bittersweet, with the 2005 sequel being completely unneeded, but I feel they could still expand the story a bit more and extend the 'people change' motif. Even though the movie is a product of its time and suffers a lot from the cliches of Disney then, it could do with a remake now or a sequel which fully ignores the 2006 midquel because it's hard to believe that it's canon."

",176,1epjh96,https://i.redd.it/sne86go221id1.jpeg,30,2024-08-11 19:20:30,"Every time I rewatch this movie, I am truly amazed at how they put so much depth and care towards this character. When she’s first introduced she’s quite rude, but charming and is seen as a woman who reluctantly works for Hades and as we get to learn more about her. We realize that she is a woman who’s still dealing with the emotional pain from her past!

Also I find a detail that gets overlooked quite a lot is how she ended up becoming the real hero of the movie. Although she betrayed Hercules, and played a role in giving Hades the upper hand, she goes out of her way to fix her mess and even scarified her own life to save Hercules which gave him back his abilities to defeat the Titans! It was through her that Hercules finally understood what it meant to be a “true hero”, when he returns the favour and risks his life to revive her soul from the Underworld. 

The only other Disney female lead that I think comes closest to being this well developed is Mulan! "

Sequel to Disney's Hercules (1997),11,1enmhvv,https://www.reddit.com/r/DisneyPlus/comments/1enmhvv/sequel_to_disneys_hercules_1997/,4,2024-08-09 07:54:29,"So I watched the Hercules movie and oh my gosh this movie was an absolute delight to witness with perhaps the best written female character in all of Disney (Meg) so naturally I looked for a sequel which was nowhere to be found on D+.

Luckily Google did but not what i expected.
They released a DVD called ""Hercules: Zero to Hero"" which is actually a compilation four episodes of the TV series in disguise.

Good news was that D+ does carry the TV series (tho your regional version might not) and yes there's a specific episode that's indeed a direct sequel to the movie called ""Hercules and the Year Book"". I wont spoil what happens but basically it recaps a bunch of other episodes and have Meg react to them since she wasn't there ofcourse (Except for one).

Now where am I going with this? I wanted to give y'all a quick start guide into the Hercules media since Disney has basically abandoned him.

Watchguide
-------------------
- Hercules (the Movie)
- Hercules and the Year Book (TV Series)
- Hercules and the First Day of School (TV Series)
- Hercules and the Aetolian Amphora (TV Series)
- Hercules and the Arabian Night (TV Series)
- Any other episode you like

Now I'll explain these choices a bit.
- While the year book episode does spoil a bunch of episodes they aren't included here so feel free to watch or skip the parts of it within the episode.
- First Day of school introduces ya to all the characters that weren't in the movie including Hercules two best friends (which Yearbook does tell you their fates off).
- The Aetolian Amphora is the sweet story of Meg's origin and her surprisingly meeting Hercules in his teenage years first prior to her movie appearance.

This might also be a good time to mention that the TV Series apparently takes place in an alternative timeline from the movie as there are some heavy plot alterations.

For one Hades found about Hercules being alive years prior to when he did in the movie.
My best guess he found out the moment Hercules first went into contact with Zeus in the temple.

Another one is to Meg's origin. In the original she sold her soul to Hades to save the man she loved. None of that in the series. Instead (spoilers) she went on a single date with Adonis which was so bad she wanted to forget about.

Theory time: The movie's origin still happened here too but AFTER she forgot about Adonis she met the other guy the movie was referring to which would be a great explanation to that plothole HOWEVER the series put quite an emphasis on Adonis being the 'guy' the movie was talking about which also explains why this episode exists in the first place.
I could tell they wanted to complete the picture the movie set but completely failed with adding even more plotholes. Anyway I'm just glad we got to see more Meg.

- Last episode Arabian Nights is a special crossover episode with Alladin and Jasmine.
It takes place AFTER ""Aladdin: The King of Thieves"" which is the third movie so be sure to watch that first since otherwise you'll be spoiled on the ending of that movie here.

Sorry for the long post but I had to write this off of me since I couldn't find any info on this or any other sub anywhere so I had to make my own post. Hope this helps new viewers!"

Didn't really have opening or closing credits. I did like ""The Sorcerer's Apprentice"" with Mickey Mouse and the rest was just okay. I ended up finishing it this afternoon. I guess my favorite part was the Nutcracker Suite, but only because of the music. 

Then I started watching ""Fantasia 2000"". I'm not that far into it  but already I like it better. The animation is more interesting and it seems like it goes with the songs better. Steve Martin kind of gets on my nerves, but I do like the comedy aspect. It's something that ""Fantasia"" doesn't really have. I'm surprised that I'd like a sequel better, but I'm looking foreword to watching the rest of it! "

Brother Bear actually is a pretty bad film,0,1ej5q6d,https://www.reddit.com/r/DisneyPlus/comments/1ej5q6d/brother_bear_actually_is_a_pretty_bad_film/,29,2024-08-03 22:15:38,"I see a lot of people defend this film and say “does anyone else think this film is underrated” and not nearly enough people criticizing it, so that’s exactly what I’m going to do right now. Brother Bear is one of Walt Disney Animated Studios’s worst films. It’s not THE worst. Chicken Little, Home on the Range, Dinosaur, Fun and Fancy Free, The Black Cauldron, and Wish are all worse, but it’s up there. This is why.

The most frustrating thing about this film is that the first 20 minutes of it are very good. They tell a story of three Native American brothers and you really feel the connection between them. There’s a great scene where the oldest brother dies and the younger two are panicked and looking for him in the water, constantly yelling his name. There’s a tense sequence where the MC, Kenai, is looking for the bear and trying to kill it. And the transformation sequence is very good and looks really nice. The animation in general isn’t the greatest, but it does look pretty good. This first act of the film genuinely feels like it’s setting up to be a darker, more mature Disney film, and the set up itself is very good.

But once Kenai actually does turn into a bear, the film takes a very bizarre and abrupt change in tone, where suddenly it‘s a very generic bad children’s film with bad jokes, annoying characters forced pop culture references, and modern slang. It’s pretty bad and none of the jokes even come close to funny. The comic relief moose are annoying and keep showing up in the film despite not being funny at all, and the kid Kenai has to look after, Koda, is annoying and you never feel a true connection between them.

The tonal whiplash here is what really bothers me. The beginning was a lot more dark and serious and hinted that the rest of the film would be like that. But instead it weirdly becomes much more lighthearted and seems more specifically geared toward a VERY young audience post transformation. It’s a mess. To compare it to another Disney film with a sort of similar premise, The Emperor’s New Groove, it’s like if the beginning was dark and serious before suddenly becoming the buddy comedy film it is. And then Brother Bear suddenly becomes darker again toward the end.

It’s the ending that really makes the film bad to me. Throughout the film you hear that Koda and his mother get separated, and it’s very obvious that Koda’s mother is the bear Kenai killed. To be fair to the film though, there is a pretty good scene later in the film where Koda is telling the story of how they got separated to a group of bears, and Kenai realizes he killed Koda’s mother. So good I almost gave the film more credit, until the scene where Kenai tells Koda he killed his mother and they play a Phil Collins song over it! This big, emotional scene that the film spent a huge portion of the runtime building up to is not something we actually get to hear play out. What makes it even worse is that there’s a version of this scene that was cut which had the dialogue in it, and it’s really good and features some great voice acting from Joaquin Phoenix. I have no idea why they would cut this in favor of a Phil Collins song where the lyrics boil down to “The characters are sad! See? See!? I’m telling you the characters are sad!” It’s one of the worst songs in any Disney film. The songs in general don’t fit the scenes they’re in here and they have the same problem they did in Tarzan, but even worse because they sound worse. The first song by Tina Turner at the beginning is actually very good, but they get worse until that last one.

The ending is where the film just completely falls apart. So, Kenai changes back after sacrificing his life for Koda’s and everything is back to normal, until Kenai realizes Koda “needs“ him and changes back into a Bear to be his new guardian. There are so many problems with this. Namely that Kenai killed Koda’s mother! That was a big point in this film and now it wants to forget that. The last person I’d want raising a kid is the guy who killed their parents. I can buy Koda forgiving Kenai enough to not want him to die, but not to the point of still being his friend and letting him be his willing guardian. And how old is Kenai anyway? 18? 19? Early 20s at the latest? Is he really old enough to be trusted with a child, especially after having anger issues for so long? Why should he be expected to care for this child just to complete some arc? This isn’t a happy ending, it’s a forced and stupid one. Even from a narrative standpoint it makes no sense for Kenai to be like “being a bear sucks I hate being a bear” only to suddenly go “actually I’m fine with being a bear for the rest of my life to raise this one kid I thought was annoying most of the film”. It’s stupid and unsatisfying.

If the film kept the scene where Kenai actually tells Koda he killed his mother without the Phil Collins song played over it, I might‘ve given more credit, but as it stands, it sucks. The rotten tomatoes score of 37% is pretty justified (what isn’t justified is that the many Disney films worse than this have higher scores).

So that’s why I think Brother Bear is bad. If anyone wants to tell me why they think the film is good, feel free to do so."

Tangled Series Review from a Dad,7,1eeyc8c,https://www.reddit.com/r/DisneyPlus/comments/1eeyc8c/tangled_series_review_from_a_dad/,0,2024-07-29 19:32:35,"So with kids age 5 and 3, I spend most of my day with Disney+ on in the background. I grew up with Disney and love it myself, but after watching Frozen, Moana, and Tangled fifty times, I needed something else. I noticed Tangled had a tv series so I threw that on and was actually impressed by it. It reminded me of those cartoons that are not for adults, but kind of are for adults. I only halfway paid attention but as a huge lover of fantasy (books like Brandon Sanderson and tv shows like Lord of the Rings / Wheel of Time), I was loving the direction Tangled took. I thought Disney must have tapped some dude to make a princess show and he’s ‘well, I’ve always wanted to make something like avatar the last airbender, but sure, I’ll slap a Disney princess paint scheme over the top’.

Anyway, between demon disciples chasing down Rapunzel on a rhino, being trapped in a psychological seashell house of horror, and conversing with psychic monkeys, I sat down and started to watch this show (No, I’m not joking). We finished all three seasons and I immediately restarted it and decided to pay attention this time. Now that I’ve finished it (again), I have to say this is truly a hidden gem on Disney+. So let me gush about it a little bit.

They got the original voices of Rapunzel (Mandy Moore) and Eugene (Zachary Levi) back. And those two absolutely kill it. Mandy brings this over-the-top optimism to Rapunzel that’s so much fun. Pascal and Maximus are back with the same personalities, as well as the crew of the Snuggly Duckling. There are new characters to round out the party. And I use that term on purpose because (especially season 2), it feels like a DnD party venturing around. Lance (James Monroe Inglehart), Varian (Jeremy Jordan), and Cass (Eden Espinosa) are the newbies for the show, and they are all awesome. Jeremy and Eden come from Broadway. Eden was actually Idina Menzel’s backup for Wicked. So, she can belt like Elsa. And belt she does.

The songs are amazing. I’m not a Broadway person. I listen to post-hardcore, metal, emo stuff in my spare time. But these songs are insane. I wish I could suggest some of them, but almost all songs are linked up to crucial character moments/arcs and it would be spoiler territory to listen before watching. Besides their voices being awesome with some high notes out of this world, the melodies are earworms and I found myself laying in bed at night with airpods in and listening to the Tangled soundtrack. I was like ‘why are these so good?’ to discover that Alan Menken wrote them! This is the OG Disney composer of the 90s. He did Beauty and the Beast, Little Mermaid, Aladdin, Hercules, Enchanted, and the Tangled movie. I was shocked that a Disney channel spinoff was able to get him attached. As a musician myself, there’s so many audio interests in here to dissect. Like multiple songs having different lyrics each time the chorus hits. Or jam-packing character motivations into the ends of the songs so they sing it rather than say it, such as in “Ready as I’ll Ever Be” where each line is sung by a different character. “I’ll make them hear me!”, “Prove they can trust me!”, “I’ll save my home and family!”

Another pro is the animation style. It’s this unique papercraft mosaic thing. It seems <30 fps, but due to the paper style, it totally fits. If you’re familiar with Zelda: the Wind Waker, I frequently felt like I was watching a show inside Windfall Island.

For those of you with young ones that have listened to Disney princess movies a million times, I urge you to give this a try. I personally think that my kids are too young to understand everything, but especially my 5-year-old boy is into it. There are sword fights and magic spells and scary moments. While the Tangled movie has that, it’s definitely a different tone in the show. The first season feels a little Saturday-morning-cartoony. Like, Rapunzel is a newly found princess and is exploring her new alt-France coastal city complete with painting classes and bake shops.

There is a main overarching story about the sun-drop, which is the power that gave her magic hair in the first place (very beginning of the Tangled movie). On my latest rewatch, I’ve written notes on each episode and put together a watch-list. Because I can totally see how someone could read this post and think ‘sounds cool, I’ll give it a shot’ and then turn it off when nothing meaningful happens in the first 5 episodes. For those of you that want to get into the core of each season’s plot, this will be for you. With context clues, I have no doubt you can skip the plentiful bottle episodes.

Required viewing:

Tangled movie, followed by ‘Tangled Before Ever After’. BEA is a 60-minute bridge between the movie and the show. It’s essentially a long pilot episode. No idea why it wasn’t episode 1 of the show.

Season 1: 101, 106, 108, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123

Season 2: 201 (only the first 3.5mn for the flashback sequence), 215, 216, 219, 220, 221, 222, 223, 224

Season 3: 301, 302, 307, 310, 312, 313, 314, 315, 316, 318, 319, 320, 321

 

It’s basically the last third of each season where the meat is. I still highly recommend all of it as it’s just fun content. But of the bottle episodes, my favorites were 109, 114, 205, 211, 305, 311

 

I also want to point out that there was some behind-the-scenes drama regarding the creator of the show with an excellent post here:

https://www.reddit.com/r/HobbyDrama/comments/u5hwcm/tv_youre_missing_the_point_or_tangled_the_series/
Do not read until you finish as there are major spoilers for all three seasons.

And if you are part of the LGBT community, there is a major character you can rally around here. It’s not overt and I don’t want to talk about it further as it could be considered spoilery, but it has spawned cosplays and its own subreddit.


If you couldn’t tell, I absolutely fell in love with this series and just want to spread the word on what I thought was an under-the-radar series on Disney+. There are so many amazing moments that I want to mention to hook new viewers, but I’m trying my best to keep things spoiler-free.

But because it is a fairly small $180mil budget so compared to the others it is probably just a ""quick money grab"" or just attracting more people to Disney + I'm not that sure but it has its fair potential of being a ""good"" show. 

But just if they want to redeem their self.

UI update?,1,1eb350f,https://www.reddit.com/r/DisneyPlus/comments/1eb350f/ui_update/,0,2024-07-24 21:40:30,"Just wanted to go over some issues I have with the current UI on the mobile app, and see if anyone else agrees. Maybe with enough visibility there could be some changes.

1) No filtering in the search bar: 
Being able to include/exclude genres would make it easier to find the content you're looking for.

2) No ""View all"" option for each subsection of a page. Looking at the Hulu page for the app, the subsections show recommendations for a particular genre. The problem with this is that it doesn't show all of the available shows/movies in that genre and there isn't a way for you to expand your view. This goes hand in hand with the 1st issue.

3) If you have something with multiple languages, they are combined in the menu under the same drop down (I.E. a Season 1 will have more than one episode 1s listed). Specifying which language in the same drop down as the season would make it much easier navigate different episodes without clicking the wrong language.

4)Sort of falls under point 1, but when you hit search you are searching through Disney+, Hulu, National Geographic, Pixar, Marvel, and Star Wars. The option to search all, or only one of those would be useful

Those are a bit of my issues ive found so far while using the app. Some good points are that the current design is simple to use and easy to figure out; I haven't found myself confused on navigating the app-- but if you want to find something that is not on the recommended lists then you need to already know the name for the search bar.

My sister used to really like it and watch it over and over. Her constant repeats got on my nerves, so I never had any desire to check it out again.

Years later and I must say, having basically never seen the film, I absolutely adore the songs and Judy Kuhn’s vocals. I’ve been watching clips lately, and the animation looks gorgeous, the raccoon’s pretty cute, and it looks like it’d be enjoyable.

However, I have heard the general consensus on this film, and what I gather is that people really dislike it, mainly due to the historical inaccuracies. 
Which is fair. The true story is so much more sad that the one I imagine the film told. 
But if I were to watch it knowing that nothing I see holds any historical accuracy whatsoever, aside from a name or two, and the idea of British colonizers invading Virginia, would it be a film worth watching? I heard that the animators and writers making the film were very passionate about the project, with most choosing to work on it over the lion king, (Which we know how that ended up turning out).

Anyways. A more learned perspective than that of my own would be interesting.
Thanks in advance! And have a great day!

I mean never mind the misleading advertisements done for the Cosmic Rewind attraction, seeing how much a lot of these attractions here were becoming less original and more focused on showcasing its concept in full to being a themed attraction focused solely on existing IPs in Disney's repertoire like with the rest of Disney's parks really kinda makes it more unappealing when it comes to how it all came together."

It didn’t matter anyways since said account was not my primary account.

After finding out Hulu's only in America (rip), I turned my eyes to Disney+ and it genuinely looks pretty neat. Here are my two questions:

1. My sister said her friend who has Disney+ has to pay extra for **most** movies. I highly doubted this so I looked it up and found no evidence of it apart from certain premieres you can watch early for a fee? I'd highly appreciate a second opinion on whether you actually have to pay extra for movies **on top** of the subscription fee, similar to Prime.

2. I live in Kosovo. Looking it up, most of the lists of available countries include it. I'd love for it to be completely confirmed without a shadow of a doubt, considering smaller countries tend to get overlooked, and Netflix became available here just about 4-5 years ago, Spotify even more recently.

Thank you in advance."

Do you think Padmé will ever make a return to the Star Wars universe on Disney+?,54,1e4jc7s,https://i.redd.it/21y1vznmbucd1.jpeg,22,2024-07-16 15:20:56,"I grew up in my early childhood watching the prequels and absolutely LOVED Padme. I know Natalie Portman has talked about how these movies almost damaged her image as an actress..but in today's day and age, I think we all know that the struggling acting of the prequels was mostly attributed to Lucas's inability to direct the actors.
That was years ago.... but NOW?

Given the revival of the Star Wars world on Disney+ over the past few years, the tremendous success of several spinoff shows (Mandalorian, Ashoka, Obi-Wan Kenobi, etc.)... I don't see any reason as to why participating in the revamp of the Star Wars universe would hurt anyone's career. Hayden Christensen even came back after stepping away from the spotlight for YEARS (healed my inner child a little bit, too). That being said, I don't think it's too far-fetched to suggest that maybe one day, even Natalie Portman would be open to making her return as Padme in another Disney spinoff.

What do y'all think?

And if she did make a return, what would her story consist of?"

I don't really want Pixar and Walt Disney Animation to be separate channels from a cartoon channel. I feel like that's going to get old REALLY fast. Instead they should just make a channel dedicated specifically to animation properties.

They could even do an adult swim sort of thing where they air The Simpsons, Bob's Burgers, King Of The Hill, Solar Opposites, and Family Guy at night.

They should also actually put Fillmore and Brandy and Mr Whiskers on Disney+ (for some reason they're missing).

Sometimes the dialogue is a mere whisper even in crowded scenes like the Group Dinner I have to Ramp the Audio on my PC up to 50, but then the Audio gets super loud & clear in the scene where jack and rose are dancing to Irish music. so at that point it's way too loud and I need to dial it back down to between 20 - 24.

  
And that is a constant with that Movie, Up and Down I have to adjust my audio, I assumed it was merely an issue with the Movie's Audio Mixing itself, but then I noticed it when Watching the Planet of the Apes Prequel Trilogy as well with other Films on Disney Plus.

  
I know on my TV it isn't way that bad, but I do still need to adjust the audio level a few times, especially when it comes to dialogue. So I wonder whether it's not the content but how Disney Plus Handles Audio Compression? IDK.

  
I don't really know what it is, But I know when watching Netflix or Amazon Prime Video I have far less trouble when it comes to Audio Fluctuations. Given there are a few films available on multiple platforms I figured perhaps people can compare and see if it is merely my own hardware issues or if it is a problem with D+ itself?"

Anyway I’m just wondering is Disney plus’s ad plan just as bad as hulus or is it acctually watchable/not to noticeable amounts of ads."

I mean I know this is a stage show and all but still, when comparing that to what these fans have come up with for some of these songs, it really is like night and day with how much more imaginative these sequences can be if they were done in animated form.

 I could easily see Disney try to adapt this into something of a two parter but when it comes to whether it'll be done in the usual CG or in 2D animation, I don't know where they would've gone with it. Though personally I could easily see this work well with a 2D style akin to some of the films from the early to mid 2000s. 

And heck, they don't even need to change too mcuh with the songs themselves, they would easily lift them straight off the official studio versions in the soundtracks and have all the cast brought back for the more spoken scenes in between them too if they wanted. "

A cheap one, a decent one, and now I have a premium one.
It doesn't matter what I do or how I setup things, every single time I play a movie where loud things are happening on the background (any action/adventure movie or any musical) I just can't hear the voices good enough.
My soundbar had Atmos finishing and it sounds outstanding when set that way in any other streaming app.
The best example that comes to my mind is the exceptional movie Encanto.
When they are taking it anyways sounds wonderfully and crystal clear, but when a song comes in, the voices fade away and I can barely hear anything they sing.
It's happening in all languages and I all the available content, both new and old from Disney.
When I play movies on other services or from my own blu-rays everything works way better and I never miss anything. What's harrowing with the voice tracks on Disney+????
Can any sound engineer fix this problem???
I present myself as a volunteer if needed, I'm a sound engineer too.
Had anyone else this problem?
Voice tracks should be always on top of anything else.

PD: I've had these soundbars...
PEAK PBS400 - the cheap one
LG S75Q - the decent one
LG S95QR - the premium one

Even with the Clear Voice setting, where almost all other sound fades do you can hear voices clearer, it still shows this problem. It fixes the problem 70% of time but everything else just sounds absolutely plain."

They’ll rather go for the bigger movies they can be certain are at least entertaining.

That’s where streaming movies come in as an outlet for smaller films, less risk involved.
Many streamers tried to make their movies “the next big thing” and are losing tons of cash with it. But what Disney did so well in the 80s/90s/00s was TV movies.

Why not return to that formula? With new tech like the Volume these projects can be shot in a week at a low budget (as long as the soundstage is owned by Disney money stays in house) and phenomena like Zenon or Highschool Musical can be repeated.

And who’s to say that these movies can’t also serve a purpose? Like closing out franchises/stories that wouldn’t get a theatrical release anymore (Solo 2/Captain Marvel 3/Eternals 2)?

Please consider the idea of more streaming movies at lower rates than blockbusters "

Anyways, let me know if there is any way to watch them. Previously it used to so easily, I used to watch everything on youtube (2009 to 2011). Funny thing is I had downloaded almost every single episode and stored them in my hard disk (which no longer works but I lost my favorite episode long before that due to some video error)."

The Rescuers ,16,1dtg0w3,https://www.reddit.com/r/DisneyPlus/comments/1dtg0w3/the_rescuers/,8,2024-07-02 14:31:00,"Just watched this wonderful movie. I hadn't seen it in at least 40 years , but I could still sing along to one of the songs, which is amazing.

There's a sequel ""The Rescuers Down Under"" . It's probably not as good as the original but it has the original voices; Eva Gabor and Bob Newhart as the mice.  I'm going to watch it next.

It's super cute and sweet and there are a couple of kind of sad parts, but I loved it. I'm going to watch it again sometime. Definitely recommend this one. It's much better than I remembered.

I also remember being at Disneyland with my parents and Bianca and Bernard (the mice) were there and I had my picture taken with them. I think that was shortly after I'd seen the movie in the theatre with my mom.

I love that Disney Plus has these classic animated movies. They really bring back wonderful memories.

New ads format,9,1dt2xge,https://i.redd.it/4glg7w31uy9d1.png,7,2024-07-02 03:18:48,"Hi everyone 

Sorry if this post isn't allowed, I couldn't see any reason why it isn't in the rules. Feel free to delete if necessary mods

I wondered if this new pop up ad is a part of Standard With Ads or on everyone's apps regardless of subscription type? It just appears a bit invasive as I was literally typing my profile PIN then it randomly pops up. I didn't mind the occasional 30 seconds advert during shows and movies (especially as I usually skip to the end, clear all ads then rewind to the start) but whilst browsing the app, it seems a little more intrusive

Anyone else noticed this?"

Disney Plus/Hulu Watchlist Limits  ,6,1dskoo4,https://www.reddit.com/r/DisneyPlus/comments/1dskoo4/disney_plushulu_watchlist_limits/,1,2024-07-01 11:52:25,"A few days ago, there was a discussion about Disney Plus/Hulu having limits on the amount of shows you could add to your watchlist. I couldn't find it a few minutes ago, so I started this one. Actually I have found that this is not the case. I had about a hundred shows in my watchlist, but then I noticed that shows I had added initially were gone (Like Ron Howard's Jim Henson documentary ""Idea Man"" which is really why I got Disney Plus in the first place).  

I realized I'd gone majorly overboard in adding shows, etc, so I've been going through my list on my PC (I added all the stuff through my TV) and watching the trailers for the movies and even watching the shorts that I had added. I deleted quite a few (I may add them back later) but I noticed that as I deleted things, other shows started appearing. ""Idea Man"" is the first one that I added to my watchlist, so it's now back in view. 

So my verdict is that it's not really that Disney Plus is putting a cap on how many things you can have in your watchlist, but that the site can only show so many at a time. I guess kind of like my library's website where I have a zillion books in it and you have to scroll forever to see them all. So one you delete an item, it moves everything over. 

This is really nice to know because I was dreading having to go through the whole site again to find those programs. 

So yea Disney Plus for exceeding my expectations yet again! The first time was when I saw how many cool programs they have available! "

I didn't think Id like it as much as I do and I'd only planned on watching a few episodes. I started with the ""Dressing Mickey and Minnie"" one where the woman designed outfits for them. I watched a couple of others, and then decided to watch the whole series.  Even the ones that didn't initially appeal to me (like the first one featuring Katy Perry doing American Idol from Hawaii) were good. Loved the segment on the Disney marathon through the park. 

I like that the episodes are only about twenty minutes long even with the commercials. I decided to get the commercial plan until I see if I really like it. 

It says there are only fourteen episodes and honestly I think I can watch all of them tonight (I've already watched about five or six) but I'm hoping there will be more. Since my watchlist is at capacity (apparently it peaks at 100), I'm going to take it off when I finish all the episodes, but hopefully there's a way to find out when and if they'll add more. It's a great show and I'm really enjoying it. "

What’s the deal with the episode order on Recess?,8,1dq3a7k,https://www.reddit.com/r/DisneyPlus/comments/1dq3a7k/whats_the_deal_with_the_episode_order_on_recess/,10,2024-06-28 04:53:55,"So, after that leak for the unproduced Recess revival, I decided to watch every episode of Recess. Now, so far it has gone swimmingly, aside from the odd colour grading on the Season 2 Christmas Episode.     
But then I reached Season 3 and noticed that it’s 39 episodes (about the same size as three seasons) so I went onto Wikipedia and noticed there were initially 6 seasons, interestingly not cut up into 13 episode seasons. I thought nothing of it, clearly some weird app thing just merged these episodes together. 

Then I noticed… the episode order is wrong. S3E1 is in the right place, but S3E2 wasn’t. I’d probably need to jump around after every episode.

THEN I noticed that the SEGMENTS were in the wrong order. S3E1a again, in the right place, but replacing S3E1b was S4E3b. Where was Segment B? I’ll tell you where. Replacing Season 4 Episode 9. Segment A. 

**THEN** I noticed on Wikedia that Seasons 3 & 4 aired concurrently on two different networks. ABC and UPN/Syndication. Kids in the 90’s would watch the same show on different channels and get different episodes. Bloody mad.     
Now, if I give Disney the benefit of the doubt, *maybe* the episodes were made, but got split due to a company order, so they wound up jumbled up. *Maybe* the episode list on Disney Plus is based around the original production order. 

…

***THEN*** I go onto the Disney Wiki and they just lumped Season 4 and 5 together! 

So, I give up. If I want to watch it, I can either keep going back and forth fastforwarding and rewinding through different episodes to get them in the proper release order just in the slim chance that they do a callback (I only ever noticed one callback in Season 2) or I can watch it in the Disney Plus order. I just wanna know why someone decided to make Seasons 3, 4, 5, and 6 of Recess a jumbled mess.

**EDIT:** Apparently according to the wiki, the episodes of Recess are in the order given for the International Release. Or at least their pairing. I would need to find a detailed list of all international episode pairings to verify."

The biggest issue I had was that so many of the scenes were filmed very very dark and it was hard to see a lot of detail in many of the fighting scenes unfortunately. 

Then one day, it was just gone. I guess it just didn’t develop the fan base Disney was looking for as fast as they wanted. It’s sucks because they didn’t put any effort into promoting it or the original movie, if they had I’m sure it would have been very successful. Plus it wasn’t even streaming for a full year I don’t think. It never had a chance. Now it feels gone forever as Disney holds the rights and unceremoniously tossed it aside. 

Sigh. "

Is Disney+ Overcharging for Upgrade to Disney/Hulu Bundle?,0,1doelgj,https://www.reddit.com/r/DisneyPlus/comments/1doelgj/is_disney_overcharging_for_upgrade_to_disneyhulu/,2,2024-06-26 02:33:14,"I had an odd situation yesterday. I've had Disney+ at $13.99/month (ad-free) for a while and decided to change to the Disney/Hulu Bundle ($19.99/month ad-free.) I did it online, it said I had to activate Hulu, but then I couldn't log into Hulu. I tried 5 times, finally called customer service (which is like getting a root canal) and was on for over an hour. Here is what I was told, in bits and pieces, summarized here:

If you are an existing customer and try to upgrade your plan, there is a ""glitch"" in the system that has been going on forever and they have no timeframe when it will be fixed. (I work in IT - that's BS.) Their options are to sign me up for Hulu separately, get charged for both ($13.99 + $17.99 = $31.98) and they will credit my account $11 each month. But $31.98-$11.00 = $20.98, not $19.99. 

Oooorrrr, I can cancel my Disney account and sign up under the Hulu bundle, but Hulu doesn't have an ad-free Hulu/Disney bundle, only an ad-free Hulu/Disney/Espn bundle at $24.99/month. Nothing against ESPN, but I have no interest, personally. 

Ooorrr... I can cancel everything, use a ""different"" email address (I only have one so I would be opening a new email just for the privilege of paying Disney) and start as a new customer. I was told the ""glitch"" only impacts current customers who are trying to upgrade, but at this point, I'm not placing any bets.

Realistically, my options are:

1) Go back to Disney+ at $13.99/month.

2) Keep Disney+ & Hulu at $19.99/month but have no access to Hulu.

3) Sign up for a stand-alone Hulu account ($17.99/month), pay for that and Disney+ ($13.99/month), hope they correctly issue the credit of $11/month and wind up paying $20.98/month instead of the advertised $19.99/month.

4) Cancel everything, sign up for the Hulu bundle at $24.99/month and pay $5 extra for ESPN that I will never use.

5) Create a new email address and sign up as a new customer for the $19.99/month bundle and hope it doesn't have the same problem.

5) Cancel everything and pay $0/month and no longer have access to shows that I like.

This was from the 2nd rep I talked to - the ""highest level support"" rep Jan, who said he couldn't transfer me to anyone higher and the number of customers impacted is classified. I asked for his title and seriously, he said he's ""the highest level support."" I went over the options with him several times, told him this was really insane, and he said ""these are the options we have available."" I was super nice, restrained, rational, I didn't call him names, because I know it's not his fault, but seriously??

Since this has been going on for so long with no end in sight, is it me or does it seem like this is an intentional scam by Disney to overcharge, hide it by calling it a credit? Most people won't notice that $13.99+$17.99-$11.00 does not equal $19.99, or at least they won't bother with it because it's ""only"" less than a buck a month. And most people won't go to the lengths I did to understand the problem and the options.

It's not about the buck-a-month. I couldn't care less about that and if they'd advertised it that way, I would have upgraded for that. But how many people are paying $1 extra per month, and Disney has no plan to fix it? How many hundreds of thousands of dollars is Disney making off this ""glitch?""

Streaming services and subscriptions are out of control anyway. But now you gotta go and scam us, too?

Has anyone else had this experience?"

So I wanted to get some feedback on which episode you think they should start with.

There’s the three specials plus the fourth special which also doubles as episode 1 of the new season.

**Doctor Who: The Star Beast (Special 1)** is obviously the first special so it seems like a natural starting point. But it also is largely a continuation of David Tenant’s time as Doctor so it might also not be a great place to start.

**Doctor Who: Wild Blue Yonder (Special 2)** is a fun, stand-alone adventure. But again, a continuation of David Tenant’s time as Doctor.

**Doctor Who: The Giggle (Special 3)** seems like a good option as it is the episode that introduces elements of the new season, including one of the villains and of course the new Doctor himself

**Doctor Who: The Church on Ruby Road (Special 4 / Episode 1)** is the true start of the new season with the new Doctor.

So which do you think is the best starting point? Vote in the poll and/or comment below!

(TLDR:  the kids account censorship on Disney +\ Hulu bundle with ads is insufficient and I need help. a love island ad played on the kid’s I babysit disney+ account that already has all the parental restrictions I’m aware of enabled. I don’t f with that at all because I don’t want an 8&9 y/o seeing that. Especially since the Disney channel used to focus on not advertising 3rd party products to kids. Someone please help or Disney please just fix this issue)

I was wondering if anyone else was experiencing this problem or had a fix for it.
[We have the Hulu/ Disney+ bundle with ads]

This morning while on a Disney+ kids account the two girls I babysit (8 and 9) were watching a children’s show, but during the break an ad for love island came on.
It had imagery that’s obviously not appropriate for an 8 / 9 year old and there was no other option but turning it off and switching to a show on an ad free service.
Thankfully I was there to turn it off immediately but they both said it was something they had seen  before on Disney.

The Disney+ website states that their ads are “filtered by each accounts age rating”; but their account was on junior mode with ratings filtered under G - TV-G with a password/parental locks.

Yet we still got an ad for people “having a fun day at the beach” while watching a Disney junior show.

This was really disappointing and I don’t think that parents/guardians should have to pay more money so their kids can watch bluey or Mickey Mouse clubhouse without worrying about leaving
 the room because a reality dating show or a horror movie ad could pop up.

I wish they would separate their Hulu and Disney ads completely and go with their original Disney channel bumper format while on the disney+ app. (Or at least children’s accounts even with the bundle)
The commercial and advertising spaces in between on the Disney channel were not brought in by 3rd party companies and they only showed Disney products/parks/IPs/developments; with bumpers created by talented artists that were specifically tailored for kids

Not trying to be one of those “my childhood was way better” people; but I feel like early 2000s TV, Disney especially, focused on family friendly censorship/advertising
But since the Hulu/disney+ bundle was added to the Disney+ app itself; it seems like theyve truly stopped caring about what they are advertising to their child audiences.

Idk if it’s a bug attached to the service or the Roku stick I was watching on but please lmk.
 I’d like to feel comfortable being able to go to the bathroom while the kids I sit are watching frozen.

Thanks.

I just checked out, DIY duck. And I thought because this was newly added and a knew short that perhaps it would be Available with descriptions… But sadly still nothing.

I am so dang sick of all of the Ads all the time from everywhere. I pay for no ads on some services because I want some reprieve, but apparently that isn't enough. The only reason I don't cancel and go with a different service is because my phone contract is paying for it all.
